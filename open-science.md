# What is Open Science?

Open science is the **movement to make** scientific research, data and dissemination **accessible** to **all levels** of an inquiring **society**. - *FOSTER Taxonomy*.

It encompasses **unhindered access** to scientific articles, access to data from public research, and collaborative research enabled by [...] tools and incentives. - *Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)*

It is a set of principles and practices that make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone – for the benefits of scientists and **society** as a whole.
 
Making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. - *UNESCO*

# The vision of Open Science

![Illustration of Open Science Process: A hand-drawn illustration by Scriberia shoowing two people representing different stages in the scientific research process, connected through a winding path through a forest. On the left, a person stands holding a notebook labeled "The Turing Way." Above them, a speech bubbles says "Here are my Data" and contains charts and graphs. The winding path leads up a mountain, passing by illustrations of data points and binary code. At the top, another person is standing in front of a large computer screen displaying charts. Above them, a speech bubble reads "Here are my Results," accompanied by various scientific symbols like checkmarks, percentages, and graphs. Along the path, another speech bubble labeled "Here are my Tools" shows a Swiss army knife, symbolising the research tools used. Another bubble at the top says "Here is my Code" and shows code lines on a scroll.](https://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/general_/public/2024-08/Scriberia%20crop.png?itok=BMxzsq4B)
