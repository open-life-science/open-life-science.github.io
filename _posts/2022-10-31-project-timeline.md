# Outreachy Project Timeline Presentation: How to #

#### This is a combination of efforts and suggestions by the Dec 2022 applicants that will help us and future applicants. I have only put it together in this blog for easy access.

During the final application process for the application round of the Outreachy internship, there are usually lots of questions concerning timeline presentation. A few suggestions below from the eyes of applicants:

### One

* Important thing is having a full and grounded understanding of what you will be working on. This will enable you split it into different milestones.
* Based on your understanding of the project, you can estimate time to each milestone you set.
* Key thing to note: Ensure you’re certain of the availability of the resources you’ll be needing before you set time frames for your tasks. This will ensure you don’t have “unplanned” stopovers.

 -**Nancy Chalcedony**
 
###  Two
 
* Understand the project you will be working on. 
* And also, understand the process you will take to achieve the project goals.
* Breakdown the whole project timeline into weeks and set goals you plan to achieve each week/2 weeks.
* Always remember that there is a deadline. For example, an Outreachy internship is 3 months, then your timeline should not exceed 3 months. 

-**Latifat Akinyemi**

### Three

* Have a distinct picture of what you want to achieve in those times.
* Don’t underestimate or overestimate; be careful when visualizing.
* If you will need to learn a new tool, put that into consideration while creating the timeline.
* Consider your strengths and weaknesses.
* Set a clear goal with each subheading you decide to go with, don’t be vague. Be as descriptive as you can be.
* Highlight a clear time frame; they are stipulations so it could be more or less. You only need estimates.

-**Bisola Ahmed**

### Four

* Identify what your tasks are  for the project. 
* Set deadlines to when you want to accomplish each tasks so that you can meet the final deadline for the entire project.

-**Chiletam Ekewuba**

### Five

* Conduct research on the task to be submitted/accomplished.
* Gather tools and resources required to complete the task
* Add time frames for specific subtask or milestones (Could be hours or days or weeks)
* An example tools you can use to create timelines: [Gantt Charts](https://clickup.com/features/gantt-chart-view?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gs_cpc_at_nnc_nb_trial_all-devices_tcpa_lp_x_all-departments_alpha_use-case-plus-features-best-audience&utm_content=all-countries_kw-target_text_all-industries_gantt-chart_all-use-cases_free&utm_term=e_gantt%20chart%20template%20free&gclid=Cj0KCQjw48OaBhDWARIsAMd966A3h8_njFdNuGIT7tHIU8haoWuRMTcI_hfdNl6JO_CcitjN2vaez_UaAgYQEALw_wcB)

### Six

-**Margaret Pearl**

* Make a visual list of tasks (name them accordingly)
* Set date for deliverables (deadline).
* It gives you and everyone working with you a clear view of what you're working on and when you're expected to deliver those tasks.

## Questions

How do we know what project to work on? Would it be selected randomly?

More or less. Based on the tasks we have been solving and what else you think might benefit the community. There is also a guide to what the interns will be working on in the OLS landing page on Outreachy. A collation of this will give an idea what you will do as an intern. 

-**Bisola Ahmed**


The project the intern will be working on is an extension of what we are working on in the contribution phase already. And also, on the OLS page on Outreachy website, the tasks to be worked on by selected interns was specified. Although, the tasks might not be limited to that. If you notice an issue that you feel you can solve as part of your internship tasks, I think you can add that when writing your project timeline.
