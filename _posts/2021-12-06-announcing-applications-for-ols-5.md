OLS-4 is approaching its last cohort call, which means that we are preparing for the graduation of our current cohort 
and setting things up for the OLS-5 in 2022.

## OLS-4 Graduations - You're All Invited!

Our amazing project leads for OLS-4 brought over 20 projects from around the world and have been working hard amid the pandemic to advance their knowledge in open and reproducible research practices while establishing themselves 
as experts in their fields ([see our projects and participants]({% link openseeds/ols-4/projects-participants.md %})). 
We are lucky enough to witness their projects and network grow while working alongside our mentors, expert speakers, 
and call facilitators.

It's time to set the stage for them to share their projects with the wider open science communities through our graduation calls on 18, 19 and 20 January 2022.
We invite you to come and watch the [live-streamed calls on YouTube]({{site.youtube}}) - they'll be spread across three different 
hour-long sessions, and available on YouTube after the event if you can't attend in real-time. 

These calls will be hosted for the OLS members via Zoom and livestreamed for everyone on YouTube with real-time captions using Otter.ai.

**Please register for one (or all) graduation calls via the [Eventbrite pages](https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/ols-4-graduations-44929)**.

We especially welcome you if you are:
- friends, family, colleagues, of the current project leaders who are graduating.
- planning to apply for OLS-5 and want to see what our current projects are like.
- interested in learning about the OLS and what we do.
- from an open research institute, funder, journal, or anyone else who would like to see some of the shining stars of early open science projects from this cohort.

## Call for application for OLS-5 is NOW OPEN!

Interested in applying for the next round? We can't wait to see your project proposal! 
Please submit your application via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=openlifesci.org/Open_Life_Science/2022/Cohort_5) before the end of the day on **15 January 2022** (hard deadline). **Important note:** The deadline for registering for OpenReview is 12 January, as all OpenReview accounts are approved manually. 
To learn about the timeline, process and details for the OLS-5, visit our homepage: [{{ site.url }}]({% link index.md %}) and
[GitHub repo with application guidelines]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/application-forms).


We encourage you to watch the OLS graduations from the last three cohorts [on YouTube]({{ site.youtube }}) to get a sense of what the project will be like (direct link to [OLS-3 graduation calls](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1CvC6Ez54KD01eg-XVq0AUHNEpG9dnrA)).

For OLS-5 we'll be offering micro-grants, as we did in [OLS-3 and OLS-4]({% link _posts/2020-11-23-micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4.md %}) to help grow participation and inclusion, and to support budding new projects. More details regarding the budget will be shared in a separate blog post.
