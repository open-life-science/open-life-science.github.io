It's hard to believe, but OLS-2 is in its final stage right now, which means that OLS-3 is just around the corner in 2021.

## Graduations - you're all invited!

Our amazing project leads for OLS-2 came from six different continents around the world and have been working on projects covering open reproducible data science, open hardware, open synthetic biology, usability, ethics, local open science communities, conference, and [many more incredible things]({% link openseeds/ols-2/projects-participants.md %}). We've been lucky enough to work with them as mentors, expert speakers, and call hosts for nearly four months - and now it's time to shed a tear of pride as graduations approach.

We invite you to come and watch the [live-streamed calls on YouTube]({{site.youtube}}) - they'll be spread across three different hour-long sessions, and available on YouTube after the event if you can't attend in real time. All calls will have real-time captions using Otter.ai.

We especially welcome you if you are:
- interested in applying for OLS-3 and want to see what projects are like.
- friends, family, colleagues, of the current project leaders who are graduating.
- from an open research institute, funder, journal, or anyone else who would like to see some of the shining stars of early open science projects from this cohort.

## Call for application for OLS-3 is NOW OPEN!

Interested in applying for round three? We can't wait to see your application - visit [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ols3) to submit your application before the end of the day on January 11th.

For OLS-3 we're also excited to announce that [we'll be offering micro-grants]({% link _posts/2020-11-23-micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4.md %}) to help grow participation and inclusion, and to support budding new projects.
