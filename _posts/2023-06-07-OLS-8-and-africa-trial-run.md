We have launched Open Seeds OLS-8 Cohort, our signature open science mentoring and training program. 

This is a **16-week long mentorship and cohort-based training**, where participants (organisers, hosts, mentors and project leads/mentees) 
**share** their expertise and gain knowledge essential for running open science projects, **connect** with members across communities, 
backgrounds, and identities, and **empower** each other to become effective open science ambassadors in their communities. 

Participants join this program **individually or in teams**, with  **projects** they either are already working on or want to start 
developing during the program. 

## An Africa in-person trial run

Importantly, as part of this 8th version, we are also launching a **trial run** in **Kenya** and **South Africa**. This trial run involves 
up to four in-person mentorship sessions for a maximum of three selected participant projects from each country.  

A maximum of **3 projects from Kenya** and **3 from South Africa** will be admitted into the trial run. If more projects from these 
countries apply and get selected for Open Seeds, a second selection process for the trial run will take place. 

The goal, learning objectives, timelines, and schedules can be found on OLS's [website](../openseeds/ols-8.md). 

For applicants in **Kenya**, it is essential to note that to be considered for the in-person mentorship support, projects must be related to 
**bioinformatics as well as open science**. Open Seeds will collaborate with the 
[Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya Initiative](https://github.com/bioinformatics-hub-ke/) (BHKi) to support the mentorship program. BHKi is a 
hub dedicated to bridging the gap between bioinformatics experts and aspiring bioinformaticians achieved through mentorship, training, and 
fostering collaborations within the Kenyan bioinformatics community.

In the case of **South Africa**, we **specially invite social sciences and humanities projects** as additional support will be provided via 
the [ESCALATOR programme](https://escalator.sadilar.org/) hosted by the 
[South African Centre for Digital Language Resources](https://sadilar.org/index.php/en/). ESCALATOR supports the development of a South 
African community of practice in digital humanities and computational social sciences. Successful project team members may be invited to 
the [DH-IGNITE](https://dh-ignite.org/) events to present their projects. 

All other eligibility criteria for Open Seeds apply.
