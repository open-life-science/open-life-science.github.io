Open Seeds participants of OLS-7 are graduating this week!
Read on to find out how you can attend Open Seeds OLS-7 graduation calls to celebrate and learn more about their work,
and how you can join as a participant in the next cohort, Open Seeds OLS-8.

# Open Seeds OLS-7 graduations: you're invited!

Around [50 individuals]({% link _posts/2022-12-01-announcing-applications-for-ols-7.md %}) with 30 projects
from all around the world participated in OLS-7 ([see our projects and participants]({% link openseeds/ols-7/projects-participants.md %})). 
We have reached the 16th week of the Open Seeds Mentoring and Training Programme.
Our participants have learnt from the OLS team, their mentors, experts, facilitators, and peers about open research practices, 
reflected deeply and practised open skills in their own communities and contexts, and grew their ideas and projects. 
We have admired their commitment towards open science as they built their projects and networks.
We are immensely proud that Open Seeds OLS-7 participants are graduating this week and taking the next steps as open leaders and ambassadors of open research.

In their graduation sessions, they will present and share their work with the wider community. 
We sincerely invite everyone to join, to learn more about project leads' journeys, celebrate their work, 
ask questions, and explore new ideas and collaborations!

You are invited to the watch party of two Open Seeds graduation calls, which will be [live-streamed on YouTube]({{ site.youtube }})!

- **Session 1**: 14 June 2023, 14:00 - 15:30 BST ([in your time zone](https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2023-06-14/14:00))
