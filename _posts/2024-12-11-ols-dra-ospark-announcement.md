We are beyond excited to the launch of the **Open Science Promotion and Advocacy for Research Knowledge (OSPARK)** project, 
a groundbreaking collaboration between [Open Life Science]({{ site.url }}) (OLS) and [The Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/) (DRA)!

Scheduled to begin in **January 2025**, this 2-year initiative is funded through the **Open Science Clusters’ Action for Research and Society** ([OSCARS](https://oscars-project.eu/)), and represents our approach to 
**equipping the Open Science community with practical marketing and communication skills** to help create visibility for services provided by research support infrastructures as well as for researchers and their research findings.

The OSPARK project aims to develop a training program implemented in a **multi-week bootcamp with both online and onsite participation** to empower members of the OSCARS Science Clusters and the broader Open Science community with evidence-based marketing and communication skills. 

In the first year of the project, the curriculum for the bootcamp will be developed based on research into both current best-practices and knowledge from experts in the field. Once the curriculum is developed, the bootcamp will be iteratively implemented in the second year to fine-tune the curriculum and participant experience.
