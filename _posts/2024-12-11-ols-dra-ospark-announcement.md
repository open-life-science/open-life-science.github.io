We are beyond excited to the launch of the **Open Science Promotion and Advocacy for Research Knowledge (OSPARK)** project, 
a groundbreaking collaboration between [Open Life Science]({{ site.url }}) (OLS) and [The Digital Research Academy](https://digital-research.academy/) (DRA)!

Scheduled to begin in **January 2025**, this 2-year initiative is funded through the **Open Science Clusters’ Action for Research and Society** ([OSCARS](https://oscars-project.eu/)), and represents our approach to 
**equipping the Open Science community with practical marketing and communication skills** to help create visibility for services provided by research support infrastructures as well as for researchers and their research findings.

The OSPARK project aims to develop a training program implemented in a **multi-week bootcamp with both online and onsite participation** to empower members of the OSCARS Science Clusters and the broader Open Science community with evidence-based marketing and communication skills. 

In the first year of the project, the curriculum for the bootcamp will be developed based on research into both current best-practices and knowledge from experts in the field. Once the curriculum is developed, the bootcamp will be iteratively implemented in the second year to fine-tune the curriculum and participant experience.

## More about OSCARS 
OSCARS is a four-year EU-funded project that strives to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe by consolidating the achievements of world-class European research infrastructures in the ESFRI roadmap and beyond into lasting interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices. The project aims to strengthen the role of the Science Clusters in the ERA by developing domain-based Competence Centres and by fostering the implementation of Open Science projects funded through a cascading grant mechanism.

The EU logo sits on the right, and is a blue square containing a circle formed by yellow stars. Further right of the blue square, are the words "Funded by the European Union"]({% link images/logo/OSCARS-logo-EUflag.png %})
