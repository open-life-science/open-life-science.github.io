One of our fabulous mentors and experts, Aidan Budd, is a trainer for life science leadership courses.

Normally, he'd be running some practice training sessions in-person, but unsurprisingly it's a little harder to recruit rooms full of trainees during a pandemic. OLS mentees, mentors, experts, and anyone who might be interested in OLS in the future are all invited to participate - helping out a friend and colleague as well as getting the chance to learn leadership skills.

The full curriculum is available on the course website, but practice sessions can run for 30 minutes to an hour. http://lab-management.embo.org/dates/ell-gl-2020
