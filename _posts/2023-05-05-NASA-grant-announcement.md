For many, 2023 is the [Year of Open Science](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/11/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-advance-open-and-equitable-research/). OLS and [MetaDocencia (MD)](https://www.metadocencia.org/) are delighted to announce that we will be participating in the Year of Open Science by **delivering Open Science training** for **[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/)**, using materials originally developed by [a huge group of open researchers worldwide](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content/#contributors), alongside [American Geophysical Union (AGU)](https://www.agu.org/).

## What will we do? 

Spanish is the **second most spoken language in the United States**, after English. When NASA launched the grant call, MD & OLS partnered to propose a **dual Spanish/English language set of training cohorts** using our expertise in online virtual cohort training and Spanish-language education. [**We are delighted to share that we've been awarded a three-year grant to deliver this training!**](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2023/nasa-boosts-open-science-through-innovative-training/)

The training will cover [the five modules in OpenCore](https://opensciency.github.io/sprint-content), and participants will work with a mentor to discuss real-world application of the skills they use. The schedule for individual cohorts is shown below:

| **Cohort timeline** |                | Before the course |   |   | Week |   |   |   |   |   |
|---------------------|----------------|:-----------------:|:-:|:-:|:----:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|                     |                | 8 weeks | 4 weeks |  2 weeks | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| **Pre-cohort**      |    Application period opens        |  x |  |  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                     |    Application period closes       |   | x |  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                     |    Applicants notified             |   |  | x |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| **TOPS OpenCore module 2.5 hours each** | **Ethos**  |   |   |   | 2:30 |   |   |   |   |   |
|                                         | **Data**       |   |  |   |    | 2:30 |  | |  |   |
|                                         | **Software**   |    |   |  |  |  | 2:30 |  |  |   |
|                                         | **Results**    |    |   |  |  |  |  | 2:30 |  |   |
|                                         | **Tools & Resources**  ||  |  | | |  |  | 2:30 |  |
| **Final Graduation**                    |Group live-streamed presentations | || | || |||2:30|
| **Mentor** (30 mins) | 1:1 or 1 mentor:group project || | | 0:30 | 0:30 | 0:30 | 0:30 | 0:30|
| **Reflection & implementation** | Self-led by participants <br>- optional assignments <br>- prep for final presentations | | | | 1:00 | 1:00 | 1:00 | 1:00 | 1:00 | 1:30 |
|                        | Weekly hours  |  |   |   | 4:00 | 4:00 | 4:00 | 4:00 | 4:00 | 4:00 |

We plan to run **five cohorts per year**. 
  
## What's the difference between this and OLS's traditional mentorship training? 

We foresee this being very similar to what we already did, but **more condensed** - rather than ~2 hours over 16 weeks, participants will be spending ~4 hours over 6 weeks. We may also add **additional seminars and group discussions** to cover topics that were in the OLS curriculum historically, but that aren't part of OpenCore. 

## What does this mean for OLS and MetaDocencia? 

In a word: **Sustainability**. 

We're delighted to have a **three-year roadmap** to help us keep **doing the work we love**. We'd also spent time **brainstorming ways to collaborate** as organisations, and one of our biggest **joint dreams** was to run *Espa√±OLS* - Spanish-language-first open research training.

After OLS-8, we'll **probably take a break from the longer-format mentoring cohorts** (recently rebranded to be [*Open Seeds*]({% link  _posts/2023-04-18-Introducing-the-new-OLS.md %}), at the very least until we get comfortable with running these shorter, more intense cohorts. This break will also give us time to [further **evaluate and understand the impact** of OLS-1 to OLS-8]({% link  _posts/2022-02-18-ols-is-hiring.md %}), and to invest into [**localizing Open Seeds**]({% link _posts/2022-12-20-ECB-grant-announcement.md %}). 

That said - one of the biggest focuses for OLS and MD has **always** been **global community**, so we're still **looking for different ways** to **fund and support** our **networking**, our **global opportunity** and **skillsharing**, and the compassion and love we get from you all.
