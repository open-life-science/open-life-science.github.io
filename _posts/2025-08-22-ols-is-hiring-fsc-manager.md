## More about Fiscal Sponsorship at OLS. 

OLS's original core mission focused on mentoring and training in Open Research. Eventually we added two other pillars of activity: 

- Research on open practices
- Incubation of open initiatives

As part of the incubation pillar, people who had participated in our training initiatives often asked for advice in taking the "next steps" for their projects - e.g. applying for grants or awards, paying contributors for their time, and handling the tricky legal parts. Eventually, we began [fiscally sponsoring other small organisations]({% link open-incubator/fiscal-hosting.md %}), beginning with RSE-AUNZ. In the Open Science and Open Research domains, other fiscal sponsors you might have heard of are Code for Science and Society, Software Freedom Conservancy, NumFocus, Open Collective, and Community Initiatives. Unlike these (mostly) USA-based initiatives, OLS is based in the UK, which is why it is helpful if applicants have UK-specific experience.
