We’re delighted to share that OLS has two new staff members: Tajuddeen, who has joined OLS as the coordinator for our [collaborative ECB grant]({% link _posts/2022-12-20-ECB-grant-announcement.md %}), and Debs, who has joined the OLS team as a junior web developer. Between Tajuddeen, Debs, and Jilaga (OLS’s Outreachy intern for re-branding), Nigerians are now the most highly-represented nationality in the OLS team!

My name is Tajuddeen Gwadabe and I have a PhD in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Chinese Academy of Science. I am really interested in organising and coordinating stuff and that led me to a career in project management. 

I passionately care about learning new cultures and meeting people from all over the world. Currently I have interacted with people from other 40 countries either physically or virtually.

My name is Deborah Udoh A.K.A Debs. I'm a Nigerian, of the Anang tribe in Akwa Ibom state. Fun fact! Anang people are rumoured to be cannibalistic. I'd rather devour Jack Reacher novels though.

My passions in life are people and tech. So, I'm studying to become a Nurse Practitioner, while simultaneously practising Web Development.

I love food, podcasts, photography, horror flicks and making computers do my bidding (* evil laugh *).

There's a short list of things I won't do for dark chocolate and ice cream!
