We're super excited to be launching the fourth cohort of Open Life Science, our open research training and mentorship programme!

# OLS-3 graduated!
Over the last half a year, our fabulous OLS-3 aka Masked cohort project leads have been working on open projects, from developing UX for open-source software, to games to engage citizens in research ([see the full list](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2021/02/04/ols3-announcement/)). Many have graduated in the last month, and more to come! Please see some of our graduation recordings and notes to learn more about OLS-3's projects:

# OLS-4 applications are NOW OPEN!
**[Apply now](https://openreview.net/group?id=openlifesci.org/Open_Life_Science/2021/Cohort_4) for round 4 of our open research training and mentorship programme, until July 15 (end of the day, anywhere in the world)!**

This time round, we will be using Open Review for submissions - but worry not, our [application guide and templates](https://github.com/open-life-science/application-forms) have got you covered, just *make sure you register on Open Review well in advance*.

We'd love to welcome folks from all around the world, at different career stages to apply, individually or in teams.

For OLS-4, we continue to [offer micro-grants](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2020/11/23/micro-grants-in-2021-ols-3-ols-4/) to help grow participation and inclusion, and to support budding new projects.

We have also partnered with The Alan Turing Institute, EOSC-Life and the Faculty of Applied Sciences, Technical University of Delft to further engage researchers in these communities in open research.

Got questions about applying, or would like to learn more about the programme? Please join our application webinar and clinic on June 30 and July 9 - more on [our homepage](https://openlifesci.org).
