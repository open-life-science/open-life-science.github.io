        <p>This project, as part of the <strong>Open Life Science community</strong>, is committed to providing a <strong>welcoming, friendly, and harassment-free</strong> environment for everyone to <strong>learn and grow by contributing</strong>. As a result, we require participants to follow our <strong>code of conduct</strong>.</p>

<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the
community, as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed
to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of
conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned
from the community.</p>

<p>Our open source community strives to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be friendly and patient.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be welcoming</strong>: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports
people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to
members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration
status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief,
religion, and mental and physical ability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be considerate</strong>: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be
communicating in someone else’s primary language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be respectful</strong>: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a
personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Be careful in the words that we choose</strong>: We are a community of
professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do
not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary
behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to: Violent
threats or language directed against another person, Discriminatory jokes and
language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or
threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information
(“doxing”), Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms,
Unwelcome sexual attention, Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above
behavior, Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to
stop, then stop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Try to understand why we disagree</strong>: Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity
contributes to the strength of our community, which is composed of people from
a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on
issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean
that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each
other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and
learning from mistakes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="diversity-statement">Diversity Statement</h3>

<p>We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community
for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as
fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we
expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or
offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do
our best to right the wrong.</p>

<p>Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age,
gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national
origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation,
socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination
based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with
disabilities.</p>

<h3 id="reporting-issues">Reporting Issues</h3>

<p>If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the organisers - Bérénice, Malvika and Yo.
(team@we-are-ols.org).</p>

<p>To report an issue involving one of the members, please email one of the members individually
(berenice@we-are-ols.org, malvika@we-are-ols.org, yo@we-are-ols.org).</p>

<p>All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Your contact information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
include a link.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Any additional information that may be helpful.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the
incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how
to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team,
they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint
originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different
member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the
purpose of protecting victims of abuse.</p>
