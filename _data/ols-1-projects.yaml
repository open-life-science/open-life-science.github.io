- name: Open Science Community Barcelona (OSCBa)
  participants:
    - bonetcarne
  mentor: Zebetus
  description: >
    This project aims to create a community of local scientists to share and promote open science in Barcelona, 
    Spain. I would like to use as an example the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">OSCU</a> 
    and other initiatives like openscience beers in Montreal. The initial goal would be to reach researchers 
    from different institutions: UB, UPC, UPF, UOC, 
    UAB, etc. and meet informally in a bar/pub periodically.<br>
    
    During the meetings we would present/talk about what we do, we will promote knowledge
    exchange and will discuss on how we could improve our research in terms of open science,
    for example performing more transparent research and sharing data/code.
    Later on, the plan is to use this community to create workshops and symposia about open
    science and to agree on some common needs. For example, a common need in life science
    research group would be to have resources to help researchers in terms of data sharing or
    interactive paper publication. If we can define common needs we will be able to apply for
    some funding to cover them.<br>
    
    We will also use this plantform to motivate colleages from other parts of the country to create
    their own local community and then connect for some events.

    Investigate feasible solutions to help create a system that creates, collects and processes
    data efficiently for impactful research especially for driving health research and driving health
    related policies.
  participants:
    - ewuramaminka
  mentor: VickyNembaware
  description: >
    Most sub Saharan African countries barely have quality health data for national policy
    making, especially on cancer. Thus, more work might be needed to improve the data quality,
    especially from regions with insufficient health data registries. This project seeks to
    investigate feasible solutions to help create a system that creates, collects and processes
    data efficiently for impactful research especially for driving health research and driving health
    related policies.<br>
    
    In this project, I will focus on: improving quality of gender data generated in sub Saharan Africa for research and
    driving health policies, creating room to make health surveillance possible and easy for policy makers to take
    data driven decisions, and helping establish framework to run health data registries in more regions within 
    sub-Saharan Africa.

    Infusing a culture of open science within the community of researchers at the Zuckerman Institute
  participants:
    - ChiaBertipaglia
  mentor: mkuzak
  description: >
    The community of <a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute</a> is composed of neuroscientists at
    all career stages (graduate students, postdocs, faculty members). The Office of Scientific
    Programs, where I work, was established to build and nurture the community by fostering a
    professional environment that is welcoming, safer, diverse and inclusive. In its first year of life,
    the Office has identified relevant issues that seeks to pursue in order to support a collaborative
    climate of interdisciplinary research and discovery. Transparency is a key value of the
    Zuckerman Institute’s mission, and the Open Life Science mentor program is the perfect
    platform for me as the Assistant Director of Scientific Programs, to elaborate a strategy that will
    infuse open science best practices in the community. I hope that with the help of the cohort and
    the mentor, I can design a strategy to infuse a culture of open science within the community of
    researchers at the Zuckerman Institute. Ideally this would include power mapping, stakeholder
    mapping, action plans, and outreach. In the long run, work done in this project aims at
    developing community engagement for policy development, and will ultimately pave the way to
    establish the Zuckerman Institute as a golden standard for open science.

- name: Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya (BHK)
  participants:

  mentor: tobyhodges
  description: >
    The Bioinformatics Hub of Kenya is an entity that develops and manages training in
    bioinformatics and computational biology and provides a space in which research in
    bioinformatics is practiced.<br>

    The aim of the hub is to provide a vibrant environment that fosters research excellence,
    facilitating the immersive engagement of established and upcoming bioinformaticians with
    computational and data intensive activities in biology and the life sciences, and promoting the
    discipline of bioinformatics in Kenya. <br>

    Our mission is to bridge the gap between well established and aspiring bioinformaticians
    through peer training and mentorship to provide a pool of qualified bioinformaticians who will
    focus on innovation and bringing novelty to assigned projects promising quality, integrity,
    reliability and trust in their services.

- name: plenoptic
  participants:
    - billbrod
  mentor: rodrigocam
  description: >
    <a href="https://pypi.org/project/plenpy/">plenoptic</a> is a Python package for computational
    vision with two main components: standard differentiable models of the visual system and synthesis
    methods. The models operate on images and make predictions about perception or neural activity,
    and are relatively simple, with a small number of parameters; they can thus be used out-of-the-box
    on arbitrary images. To start, we will focus on spatial vision, so the inputs are expected to be static
    grayscale images. Synthesis methods are used to better understand models of this type. The most
    common applications of computational models are simulation (holding the parameters and input
    constant, while predicting the output) and learning (holding the input and output constant, while
    fitting the parameters). In synthesis, the output and parameters are held constant while the input
    is fit. This allows scientists to develop better intuition about which aspects of images their models
    consider relevant and which they ignore, as well as to carry out more efficient and effective model
    comparison and validation experiments. We will include four such methods, all of which have been
    described in the literature, but none of which have standard, accessible implementations that work
    on more than a handful of specific models.

  description: >
    [Biodiversidade em Foco](http://www.abc.org.br/atuacao/nacional/projeto-de-ciencia-para-o-brasil/biodiversidade-em-foco/)
    (@Biodiversity in Focus, in English) will merge a twitter account
    and a blog to promote science communication about Brazilian biodiversity. The project will
    coordinate daily posts communicating recent research findings about Brazilian biodiversity in
    twitter from researchers in different degrees of scientific career and thematic areas. Different
    researchers will administrate the twitter account during a week, time when they will provide
    daily posts about their area of expertise. Posts will be published in Portuguese in order to have
    higher national reach. Blog will present general information about the project and will
    summarize individual and community-level efforts, as well as semesterly reports of the project.
    Reports will be published in Portuguese and in English to share our experience to a broad
    audience and promote science communication. Reports will consider the number of tweets,
    participants, their experience during the account administration time, the number of followers
    and reach information in the twitter account and the blog.

- name: Media Lab Nepal for Computational Biology
  participants:
    - sudarshangc
  mentor: 
    - aidanbudd
    - malvikasharan
  description: >
    <a href="https://medialabnepal.com/">Media Lab Nepal</a> is only one community bio lab of Nepal focusing on democratization of life
    sciences through open science. It is an interdisciplinary team of students and
    experts with different backgrounds- basic science, engineering, journalism and
    management. It acted as a community partner for Darwin- India’s biggest evolutionary movement and
    innovation partner for Hult Prize Purbanchal University. The team is connecting
    innovations to entrepreneurship for maintaining sustainability. We are also
    partnering with community bio labs of our neighbouring countries like India,
    Bangladesh and Pakistan.<br>
    
    I want to initiate computational biology in Nepal to more number of enthusiasts
    from different fields during this program. Getting the support from mentors, like
    minded people and their mentoring will help for the sustainability of our project.
    At least if we can initiate this step and give platform to more number of students,
    we can benefit life sciences sector of whole country through open science
    initiative. I also want to make this initiative feasible and sustainable by creating
    incoming generating platform with computational biology.

- name: InterMine Similarity Explorer
  participants:
    - lazycipher
  mentor: yochannah
  description: >
    <a href="http://intermine.org/">InterMine</a> is a powerful open source data warehouse system. 
    It allows users to integrate
    diverse data sources with a minimum of effort, providing powerful web-services and an
    elegant web-application with minimal configuration. But InterMine warehouses are
    fragmented as there’re 30 InterMines which are not interconnected. Project BlueGenes aims
    to integrate all the sources and provide a single interface to access the data of all 30
    InterMines.<br>

    This project aims to develop a javascript based tool which will be embedded on BlueGenes
    list pages (which can be of genes or proteins). This tool will allow users to find similarities
    between different genes or proteins that are provided in the list. In order to enable this, we’ll
    make an explorable graph visualization of the relationships between InterMine entities
    (proteins or genes). Each entity or object will be represented as a node.<br>

    The idea is that visualizing things helps us to spot patterns. So, we’ll have this tool, which
    will visualize the interactions and similarities between different entities and there will be
    options to tweak the appearance/structure to make things more explorable.

- name: Open Connect Platform in Africa
  participants:
    - Lilian9
  mentor: kipkurui
  description: >
    In Open community, there is disconnect between Open practitioners and advocates hence need for
    platform to connect everyone within open landscape. Therefore, Open Connect will be a platform where
    everyone across the divide will be part of the solution through lessons, trainings and mentorship. This is
    an interactive platform targeting students, early career researchers, policy makers and senior
    researchers in shaping Open policies each country at a time in Africa. Since Africa poses different and
    unique development dynamics, development of all phases of this project will put into consideration
    various divides such as rich vs poor, rural vs urban, research literate vs research illiterate among others.

- name: EMBL Bio-IT Community Project
  participants:

  mentor: malvikasharan
  description: >
    <a href="https://bio-it.embl.de">Bio-IT project</a> at the <a href="https://embl.org">European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)</a>
    is an initiative established in 2010 to support the development and
    technical capacity of its diverse bio-computational community.<br>
    
    After finishing my PhD recently at EMBL, I took
    the next role as a Bio-IT community coordinator within the same organisation. In order to perform
    effectively in my job, I want to formally gain community management skills and understand
    the various tasks and responsibilities within the Bio-IT project. With my application to the
    Open Life Science program, I want to be paired with a mentor, potentially Malvika Sharan,
    who is my predecessor in Bio-IT. I want to take this opportunity to ensure a smooth
    knowledge transfer within the management team of the Bio-IT project and navigate my own
    path and future prospects as a community manager.

    Oxford Neuroscience Open Science Co-ordinator: Changing Culture
  participants:
    - cassgvp
  mentor: npscience
  description: >
    The <a href="https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/">Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (WIN)</a> and other centres in Oxford
    Neuroscience recently received large awards which include substantial components of open
    science. These centres have thus far focused on developing the infrastructure required to
    share data and tools, and are now ready to turn their attention to the ethical, ecological and
    social challenges of supporting the uptake of open science practices. I have been recruited
    as an Open Science Co-ordinator for Oxford Neuroscience, to work between departments
    and alongside partners in other institutions to develop policies and recommendations for
    good governance that work for individual facilities (e.g. WIN), across departmental
    boundaries within medical sciences (e.g. Oxford Neuroscience), and then beyond into the
    wider University and national networks. The aim is to develop an open science community
    through an understanding of the principles of behavior change, including recognizing
    scientific and individual risks and benefits for research participants, researchers (at all
    levels), and the institution.

    AMRITA: an online database for herbal medicine
  participants:
    - anayan321
    - davidviryachen
  mentor: hdinkel
  description: >
    In South East Asia, herbal medicine has been used over the century as preventive
    and therapeutics intervention. However, due to the scarcity of scientific evidence, the use of
    herbal medicines is limited to local wisdom. Several constraints such as the absence of
    funding, patent issues, and most importantly, the lack of modern scientific approaches have
    prevented the pathway to this gold mine of drug discovery. Here, we propose the
    development of AMRITA, an online web-based library of medicinal herbs that include their
    phylogeny, medicinal properties, known active components and related scientific literatures
    that is open publicly to the research community world-wide. This platform would facilitate the
    collaboration of researchers across the fields of biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical
    sciences in establishing a solid foundation of medicinal plants and enabling the use of these
    plants in modern medicine.

- name: How to build an healthy and open lab
  participants:
    - elsasci
  mentor: dasaderi
  description: >  
    I would like to create a one-stop shop for new life science PIs who want to start their labs
    using principles, resources and practices found in the open space, but who may struggle to
    find and access this content themselves. More importantly, I would like to design an efficient
    communication strategy to bring this relevant content to young PIs in a way that saves them
    time and energy. This would first require understanding what PIs most needed when they
    started (and therefore which already existing resources are actually useful), and how it
    should be delivered to them - in which form, through which channels (e.g. young PIs
    newsletter), at what time(s). Then, I would like to curate existing content, repackage it in an
    easily accessible and “digestable” form, add to it, but also create readily usable tools (e.g.
    templates - not just things people have to read). Topics would include how to work openly
    and inclusively (e.g. lab codes of conduct, lab manuals, leading inclusive meetings, setting
    up a healthy lab culture etc.); how to do research open (preprints, toolkits with software to
    work open, project management tools etc.); how to train the next generation of open
    scientists; and how to open your work to the public. Finally, I would like to approach
    organisations and institutions to help more young PIs get access to these resources.

- name: Benchmarking environment for bioinformatics tools
  participants:
    - zoe_chervontseva
  mentor: luispedro
  description: >
    The aim of this project is to provide a flexible protocol and unified instruments for iterative
    benchmarking of bioinformatics tools solving various problems. The results of benchmarking
    for each particular task are to be published as a blog post. The posts are to be automatically
    updated each time somebody provide new data on the performance of any considered tool.
    There should be an ability to add new tools as well as new datasets to an existing
    comparison.

- name: EDAM ontology
  participants:
    - matuskalas
  mentor: bgruening
  description: >
    <a href="http://edamontology.org/page">EDAM ontology</a> is a long-established project, defining a common, controlled vocabulary in
    the form of a network of concepts and terms. <a href="https://ifb-elixirfr.github.io/edam-browser/#topic_0091">EDAM</a> covers topics, operations, types of data,
    and data formats used in computational life science, i.e. in analysis of biological data, with
    some bias towards molecular life science and cellular bioimaging.
    Bioimage informatics was the first larger extension of EDAM beyond mainstream
    bioinformatics and computational biology, with hhttps://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/EDAM-BIOIMAGING/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fedamontology.org%2Foperation__R9Qf06vxvFj2UbAk7pW3IMGighly successful development model
    engaging a broad community of bioimaging and bioimage analysis experts. The <a href="">EDAM-bioimaging</a>
     work was initiated by Jon Ison, Josh Moore, and others, and I have been
    responsible for its further coordination.<br>
    
    EDAM is used in applications such as registries of computational tools or training materials
    (contributing to open science), in the Common Workflow Language (<a href="https://www.commonwl.org/">CWL</a>), or in automated
    workflow composition. It is also in the process of implementation in various parts of the
    <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy project</a>. EDAM is developed in a transparent and participatory manner, similar to
    modern open source software (it is available under CC BY-SA).<br>

    The goal of this concrete mentorship project is to further extend EDAM, so that other
    communities can benefit from it, and from the applications and use cases it fosters.

    Evaluation of human platelet antigens (hpas) in multiple blood transfused individuals in Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria
  participants:
    - seun_oyemomi
  mentor: satagopam7
  description: >
    Haemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia is a leading cause of death in adults and
    children receiving chemotherapy. Platelet transfusions have become a routine part of
    practice in some settings, with the most common indication being prophylactic
    platelet transfusion (75-80%) in the case of myelosuppressive chemotherapy.<br>
    
    The aim is to determine the expression of Human Platelet Antigens in multiple blood
    transfused individuals in the study area.<br>
    
    Objectives include; determination of expression of HPA GPIIb/IIIa, assessing the rate
    of alloimmunisation in the subjects.

- name: Improving Documentation for Open Data and Software in the Agricultural Research Community
  participants:

  mentor: katrinleinweber
  description: >
    We are members of the Data Infrastructure for Agriculture Group at <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/">The University of Arizona</a>.
    Our mission is to provide scientists with open software, data, and computing that improves
    development of productive and sustainable agricultural systems. One of our persistent hurdles
    has been enabling and motivating the community to use our software and data.<br>
    
    To address this, our project will focus on improving documentation for data and software that
    our group develops, as well as identifying and sharing best practices with the broader
    community. We will include the <a href="https://docs.terraref.org/">TERRA REF project</a>, which produces
    high-resolution sensor data on crop plants, and the <a href="https://osf.io/xdkcy/wiki/home/">drone pipeline</a>, 
    which automates steps in the use of drones to study crops.
    Both projects produce open data (CC0 and CC-BY) and software (MIT/BSD compatible).<br>
    
    Our goal is to make our products more usable for our intended audience, which is primarily
    scientists across a range of disciplines from computer science to remote sensing. We plan to
    have each person in the group complete a sub-project that can be finished in 15 weeks. Each
    sub-project would result in an accompanying blog post describing the best practices
    implemented.

- name: Improving open platform accessibility
  participants:
    - christinerogers
  mentor: ha0ye
  description: >
    I'm a member of the technical team for LORIS (github.com/aces/loris), an open-source
    neuroinformatics platform that allows researchers to collaboratively collect, curate and share
    data on the brain, behaviour and genes.<br>
    
    Aside from Jupyter notebooks, gitlab, and a few platforms that focus on data storage and
    linear processing paths, it can be hard to find platforms where researchers can safely
    collaborate with real transparency, while sharing as they go through a data collection
    lifecycle the actual workflows of their open science practices.
    I work already with an open-source project that provides these tools, but our platform can be
    challenging to adopt for new projects without dedicated technical resources, given the depth
    of knowledge and time required.<br>
    
    My objective for this project is to begin tackling this from a few angles, including
    documentation, publication, and nudges in our code development process. I believe it is
    feasible in this timeline to also pilot open tools with a new project or as an extension to an
    existing project -- to start putting this idea into action.

- name: Enabling open science practices in biology education
  participants:
    - MorphoFun
  mentor: fpsom
  description: >
    The proposed project would establish a foundation for developing a tutorial on training
    researchers in biology to adopt more open science practices. The main goal would be to
    design a website (e.g., through GitHub) that would contain different chapters on how to
    accomplish different open science achievements (e.g., designing a Code of Conduct for
    collaboration, developing a data management plan, setting up an Open Lab Notebook) and
    that could be easily cloned to their personal websites and modified for their specific
    purposes. As an extension, I am hoping that this could then be expanded into a university
    course for undergraduate and/or graduate students or even as a workshop that could be
    help at different education centers, museums, or conferences. Not only would this allow
    junior faculty to get on the right foot of developing an open and inclusive lab, it would also
    help train the next generation of open scientists who trained under the faculty member. By
    making these resources freely available, it would also help maintain open lines of
    communication between lab members and make sure that expectations of the faculty mentor
    and student / staff mentees are fully transparent so that the mentoring process can be
    improved for science mentees.

  description: >
    For this application, I am presenting a project that is embedded in our vision for Open by
    Design at Open Science UMontreal (OSUM), the student initiative I co-founded in 2019. In
    brief, the project aims to optimize open practices throughout the whole research workflow,
    from open lab books to publishing one’s own website to share with citizens, by developing a
    progressive web application (PWA) that showcases and reviews open tools to do so while
    explaining why these tools can be so useful. Not only will people be able to read about the
    tools, they will have a chance to contribute to the reviews so others can see real life
    examples of such tools and get inspired! Indirectly, this project will help foster communities
    within early-career researchers in life sciences since people will have a chance to
    communicate. Because I am bilingual, the PWA will be a bilingual application to make it as
    accessible as possible. The teaching activities included in the PWA will also be taught in
    person and live-streamed during OSUM’s activities that we give around the campus. In
    short, this project aims to foster a cultural change in how people see what is open science,
    from an open/closed definition to a continuum of small changes they can do. They app will
    live at openyourscience.app as the name of the project suggest. I also registered a bunch of
    other domain names such as openbydesign.app, so I am open to suggestions.
