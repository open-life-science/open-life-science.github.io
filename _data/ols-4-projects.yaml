    "I want to develop [Genestorian](https://www.genestorian.org/), a web\

    \ A standard file format to document genetic engineering steps\n2. A web application\
    \ to generate this documentation in the browser or programmatically\n3. A web\
    \ application with a database to store such information\n\nNone of the above software\

    \ use routinely to consult the \"genealogy\" of existing biological resources,\
    \ plan the generation of new resources, and attach experimental data supporting\
    \ their successful generation.\n\nThe cornerstone of this project is the mentioned\
    \ file format. It will be similar to a data structure for a family tree: it will\
    \ store a list of entities, and a list of objects describing their relation. Something\

    Recent developments in electron microscopy have led to a significant
    scale-up in the imaging of biological tissues, making throughput a major bottleneck
    for further progress. Electron microscopes are inherently throughput limited.
    A new type of scanning electron microscopy, the multibeam electron microscopy,
    speeds up imaging by scanning the sample with an array of beams instead of a single
    beam. Furthermore, this microscope makes use of a new detection system based on
    transmitted electrons and scintillation photons, which provides comparable information
    to conventional detection methods. To make use of the full potential of this microscope,
    new methods for data management, data analysis and visualization have to be designed.
    For example, we would like to employ deep learning methods for automatic segmentation.
    We would like to apply the multibeam electron microscope to study mitotic cells,
    zebrafish development and pancreatic stress.

    We propose to build a database that compiles literature data for the
    Stöber synthesis of sílica nanoparticles. This data is aimed to generate a database
    for other studies, such as statistical and machine learning models to guide the
    design and synthesis of calibrated and monodispersed silica nanoparticles by the
    Stöber method. The data should follow the FAIR principles to make it findable,
    accessible, interoperable, and reusable, making it public and available for any
    person that is interested in the study of this synthesis. We also aim at building
    a community of contributors of new synthesis data to enrich the dataset that will
    allow better models for Stöber synthesis to be studied. Our long-term vision is
    that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will
    advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.

    We plan to create a "Research Software Engineering Association in Asia
    region -- RSE Association (Asia) ". The motive of this association would be to
    emphasize the importance of good software practices to be adopted by researchers
    in the Asian academia. Software and programming plays an important part of most
    of the research in these times. Yet, academia has not fully adopted good modern
    software practices and principles. We also plan to create an awareness of the
    Research Software Engineering (RSE) role in Asian academia so that people who
    have an expertise in software as well as research find a firm footing in academia.
    The plan in this project is to first build a community of interested people. We
    would also like to build the technical set-up required for this project like a
    GitHub repository for easy collaboration; a website which would describe the aims
    of this association, and would include information on further events of this association;
    a mailing list which people can use to join this association easily, a Twitter
    account, and a slack channel in the global RSE slack. This project is highly inspired
    from the [Society of Research Software Engineering](https://society-rse.org/)
    in the UK.  Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal is the primary applicant of this project, and
    the one who initiated the project, and came up with the idea.

    "Our initiative is called “Talleres Open Source” (Open Source Workshops
    in Spanish), a community of scientists teaching and learning about open source
    tools in Spanish. We organize workshops in which a trainer with experience in
    a certain method shows others how to apply it using open source tools, and attendees
    give it a try with short exercises. For example, “Data visualization using Python”,
    or “Digital Fabrication with FreeCAD”. We have hosted two cycles of 4 workshops
    spanning 1 month, with both software and hardware tools, as well as two stand-alone
    events about design heuristics with a local fablab.


    The goal of this project is to find common problems within Latin American scientific
    communities and hold workshops and training courses to tackle these problems.
    Each of these workshops serve as a way to connect people facing the same problem,
    introduce them to open source tools and concepts, and enable sharing resources.
    We hope attendees finish each workshop with a concrete first impression about
    the method and hands-on experience with the tool to reduce the barrier to adoption."

    of building materials, and operational energy of building typologies will be key
    in establishing the carbon footprint of buildings in Ghana. The development of
    an online platform will also allow interested groups, individuals and cooperation’s
    to submit key information needed for the computation of energy outputs in buildings.

    "I aim to develop a Python library which allows to call and apply several
    measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated data, and
    provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures.
    &nbsp;


    Measures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected
    parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e.,
    parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in
    which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual
    elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the
    study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two). &nbsp;


    Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all
    way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite
    substantially in the last couple of decades,  quantifying emergence is completely
    new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf,
    or https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289),
    but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github
    repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), programming languages
    (including Matlab which is not open source). &nbsp;


    A way to easily use & compare a set of state of the art emergence and complexity
    measures by using a few lines of code is thus missing – this is the gap that I’d  like
    to fill."

    "Established in 2018, EROS (education researchers for open science)
    is an open research working group at the University of York. We monitor and communicate
    ongoing developments within the open research landscape, provide guidance and
    training on adopting open practices, and influence incentive structures to recognise
    commitment to open research practices.


    The aim of the *EROS Stories* project is to deepen EROS as a community of practice
    by providing a mechanism for junior and senior researchers to engage in dialogue
    about their experiences with particular open research practices, and to showcase
    the resulting conversations as publicly available case studies.


    Concretely, *EROS Stories* will pair researchers, at least one of whom must be
    an ECR, and at least one of whom must have experience with a particular research
    practice. The less experienced partner (who may be senior) commits to reading
    at least one primer on a particular open research practice, and then leads a conversation
    with their partner, asking about their experiences, motivations, and insights
    and top tips for working with the practice.


    The project will help the EROS community build a shared repertoire of experiences,
    stories, tools and ways of addressing common challenges in doing open, inclusive
    research."

    early stage life development. The project looks at data from two specific parts
    of detecting life - co-evolution of life and environment and biosignature assessment
    within the context of habitability. We use data from current experimental projects
    and develop new models  to aid the growth of astrobiology search for life. The
    platform will cater to multiple sections such as- data management from all astrobiology
    projects, experiments, research labs and conferences; new tools to analyse data,
    predictive model section to simulations from the data set and collaborative forum
    to encourage citizen science.The platform will help create open source bioinformatic

    great starting point and a guide for people that want get familiar with what needs
    to be done to make their results, data, hypothesis, etc available to the research
    community and the public. However, currently it is orientated towards issues encountered
    mostly in Data Science, and while many of the resources are extendable towards
    other fields, I consider that it could benefit from specific chapters focused
    on different research areas. The aim of this project is to create such a chapter
    by understanding the exact barriers for young researchers when considering reproducible
    research in Decision Sciences. The guide would be instead of a collection of resources
    that can be simply used at the end to make “your research more reproducible”,
    a way of thinking in a way and contain resources that help you consider reproducibility
    towards the entire research.

    Although my research areas are mostly related to wet-lab, with the
    developed technologies, I am aware that computational and data analysis approaches
    in research promise great opportunities. Therefore, I am proposing the Open Life
    Science Survey analysis project to participate in the Open Life Science (OLS)
    community and make a contribution to the program. In this project, I will be working
    on already collected survey data from their 3 cohorts. In my opinion, in this
    era, barriers to open research are not technical but rather socio-cultural. Therefore,
    by analyzing OLS participant’s survey data, we could gain insight into the demography
    and socio-culture of the participants. In this way, both OLS team will get a chance
    to enhance their program for the future and I will learn how to perform data analysis,
    deal with the survey data and gain some programming skills as well. I believe
    this opportunity will help me develop my academic skills and give me different
    perspectives in open research, which are different from but beneficial for my
    current research.

    Binderhub is a service that allows users to share reproducible interactive
    computing environments through public code repositories. The subject of our project,
    Hub23, is an organisational deployment of Binderhub, designed to allow Turing
    Researchers to use binder (the user interface) to collaborate on repositories
    internal to Turing. This is sometimes necessary if the underlying repository can
    not be shared for some reason, or is not yet ready to publish openly. During the
    OLS program, we aim to build an open community around Hub23 to help to guide future
    technical developments, and encourage use and contributions from the wider Turing
    community. We will host a series of [Zero-to-Binder workshops](http://bit.ly/zero-to-binder-python)
    aimed at introducing Turing researchers to regular binder, followed by structured
    discussion of what the ideal features of a collaborative reproducible environment
    for research would be. Any conclusions and subsequent technical development will
    be fed upstream to Binderhub, and we also aim to open source the methodologies
    used to create an internal binderhub deployment, allowing other organisations
    to do so.

    The project is about the conception, organization, and coordination
    of an online event with a focus on identifying the key driving factors for a scientific
    career as a woman in data sciences. During the event, we will try to get to the
    bottom of the large gender gap in the data science field and present efforts to
    get women into this field, further driving progress towards gender equality. The
    aim of such an event is to show how diverse and attractive the job of a data scientist
    can be including open and fair data principles. My colleagues and I already organized
    such an event in July 2021. The number of participants, and therefore, the response
    and demand were so great that we decided to held the meeting again in autumn 2021
    with a slightly different thematic focus.

    "The international and open RIVER UNIVERSITY started in Poland with\
    \ its pilot in 2018 and the 1st edition in 2020.\nIts professional river education\
    \ has the ambition to change the reality by creating a strong center/network of\
    \ modern knowledge, linking experts and giving the opportunity to participants\
    \ to learn about the peculiarities of different rivers in the Baltic region and\
    \ in Europe.\nWe provide tools to use in practice, exchange information and experience\
    \ about inland waters and its impact on the Baltic Sea, to spark joint initiatives\
    \ for the sake of rivers’ good condition.\nRiverine topics always reflect source-to-sea\
    \ approach and relation to current trends, challenges, legislation regarding freshwaters,\
    \ and free-flowing rivers: restore nature law, UN restoration decade, Biodiversity\
    \ strategy 2030, European Green Deal, national recovery plans, etc.\nIn 2018,\
    \ the River University mostly served for the purpose of gathering river experts\
    \ from several transboundary basins of Poland (Odra, Vistula/Western Bug, Neman)\
    \ with their counterparts from Belarus and Ukraine to discuss i.a. issues related\
    \ to inland navigation and large infrastructure projects on straightening river\
    \ flows in these countries. 1st edition of River University in 2020 provided general\
    \ solid knowledge about healthy rivers, their benefits and threats, presented\
    \ one of the most stunning rivers in Poland – Drawa river and highlighted current\
    \ riverine challenges impacting the society. All these looking towards European\
    \ community goals, as usual.\n\nDuring the 2nd edition in 2021, we swim into Lithuania’s\
    \ waters, to dive deep – finally live! – into water challenges in the next country\
    \ in the Baltic region. We will get to know best practices of good water management,\
    \ experience with transboundary river cooperation, also innovations and developments\
    \ within sewerage system management. We can already read about flood risk management\
    \ and about river barriers to remove or mitigate in the Baltic Sea Region (https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_flood-risk-management-in-the-baltic-sea-region_2021.pdf,\
    \ https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_report_dam_removal_april_2021.pdf).\
    \ This time we ask – how are the Lithuanian rivers?\nBeing a visitor of the largest\
    \ protected area in Lithuania, crossing rivers outdoor, stepping into practical\
    \ lectures in the national park, we will also ask about how to limit riverine\
    \ pollution from tourism and how the connectivity of amazing Lithuanian rivers\
    \ is ensured.\nChecking the European background: how the situation of rivers in\
    \ Europe looks like in general? Later in time, I may widen it\
    \ to Europe, not only the Baltic region.\n\nRiver University has been granted\
    \ patronage from European Parliament and I seek and encourage water-related institution\
    \ patronage at every edition. It engages top-level lecturers and universities\
    \ and practitioners, e.g.: the University of Lausanne, Warsaw University of Life\n\
    Sciences, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries."

    'In _The Turing Way,_ we want to systematically understand community
    practices including the community engagement pathways, contributors'' roles and
    nature of their participation that have been successful at supporting its community
    of diverse contributors. Simultaneously, we want to identify factors that may
    currently prohibit short or long term commitments of our contributors and how
    they can be further supported.


    With my participation in OLS-3, I will develop a community health report of the
    project, capturing community development aspects from growth to retention. I will
    build upon the Open Source community health metric ([https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community\_Health](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health)),
    which involves evaluating contributors'' group that is actively involved in a
    project, number of new contributors that join the project, and members who leave.
    For online projects, it can also involve tracking the number of community ambassadors,
    the number of return attendees to events and the rate of churned attendees. Developing
    an ideal metric in this project will require further deliberation and consultation
    from The Turing Way team and core contributors. Hence, this project will be collaboratively
    designed with other community members by actively inviting their contributions
    and thoughts.'
