0,Open Science Community Barcelona (OSCBa),Elisenda Bonet-Carne,Harry Smith,"This project aims to create a community of local scientists to share and promote open science in Barcelona, Spain. I would like to use as an example the <a href=""https://openscience-utrecht.com/"">OSCU</a> and other initiatives like openscience beers in Montreal. The initial goal would be to reach researchers from different institutions: UB, UPC, UPF, UOC, UAB, etc. and meet informally in a bar/pub periodically.<br>
During the meetings we would present/talk about what we do, we will promote knowledge exchange and will discuss on how we could improve our research in terms of open science, for example performing more transparent research and sharing data/code. Later on, the plan is to use this community to create workshops and symposia about open science and to agree on some common needs. For example, a common need in life science research group would be to have resources to help researchers in terms of data sharing or interactive paper publication. If we can define common needs we will be able to apply for some funding to cover them.<br>
We will also use this plantform to motivate colleages from other parts of the country to create their own local community and then connect for some events.

1,"Investigate feasible solutions to help create a system that creates, collects and processes data efficiently for impactful research especially for driving health research and driving health related policies",Deborah Akuoko,Vicky Nembaware,"Most sub Saharan African countries barely have quality health data for national policy making, especially on cancer. Thus, more work might be needed to improve the data quality, especially from regions with insufficient health data registries. This project seeks to investigate feasible solutions to help create a system that creates, collects and processes data efficiently for impactful research especially for driving health research and driving health related policies.<br>
In this project, I will focus on: improving quality of gender data generated in sub Saharan Africa for research and driving health policies, creating room to make health surveillance possible and easy for policy makers to take data driven decisions, and helping establish framework to run health data registries in more regions within sub-Saharan Africa.

2,Infusing a culture of open science within the community of researchers at the Zuckerman Institute,Chiara Bertipaglia,Mateusz Kuzak,"The community of <a href=""https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/"">Columbia University’s Zuckerman Institute</a> is composed of neuroscientists at all career stages (graduate students, postdocs, faculty members). The Office of Scientific Programs, where I work, was established to build and nurture the community by fostering a professional environment that is welcoming, safer, diverse and inclusive. In its first year of life, the Office has identified relevant issues that seeks to pursue in order to support a collaborative climate of interdisciplinary research and discovery. Transparency is a key value of the Zuckerman Institute’s mission, and the Open Life Science mentor program is the perfect platform for me as the Assistant Director of Scientific Programs, to elaborate a strategy that will infuse open science best practices in the community. I hope that with the help of the cohort and the mentor, I can design a strategy to infuse a culture of open science within the community of researchers at the Zuckerman Institute. Ideally this would include power mapping, stakeholder mapping, action plans, and outreach. In the long run, work done in this project aims at developing community engagement for policy development, and will ultimately pave the way to establish the Zuckerman Institute as a golden standard for open science.

4,Expanding plenoptic Python Package,Billy Broderick,Rodrigo Oliveira Campos,"<a href=""https://pypi.org/project/plenpy/"">plenoptic</a> is a Python package for computational vision with two main components: standard differentiable models of the visual system and synthesis methods. The models operate on images and make predictions about perception or neural activity, and are relatively simple, with a small number of parameters; they can thus be used out-of-the-box on arbitrary images. To start, we will focus on spatial vision, so the inputs are expected to be static grayscale images. Synthesis methods are used to better understand models of this type. The most common applications of computational models are simulation (holding the parameters and input constant, while predicting the output) and learning (holding the input and output constant, while fitting the parameters). In synthesis, the output and parameters are held constant while the input is fit. This allows scientists to develop better intuition about which aspects of images their models consider relevant and which they ignore, as well as to carry out more efficient and effective model comparison and validation experiments. We will include four such methods, all of which have been described in the literature, but none of which have standard, accessible implementations that work on more than a handful of specific models.

It is an interdisciplinary team of students and experts with different backgrounds- basic science, engineering, journalism and management. It acted as a community partner for Darwin- India’s biggest evolutionary movement and innovation partner for Hult Prize Purbanchal University. The team is connecting innovations to entrepreneurship for maintaining sustainability. We are also partnering with community bio labs of our neighbouring countries like India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.<br>
I want to initiate computational biology in Nepal to more number of enthusiasts from different fields during this program. Getting the support from mentors, like minded people and their mentoring will help for the sustainability of our project. At least if we can initiate this step and give platform to more number of students, we can benefit life sciences sector of whole country through open science initiative.

7,InterMine Similarity Explorer,Himanshu Singh,Yo Yehudi,"<a href=""https://intermine.org/"">InterMine</a> is a powerful open source data warehouse system. It allows users to integrate diverse data sources with a minimum of effort, providing powerful web-services and an elegant web-application with minimal configuration. But InterMine warehouses are fragmented as there’re 30 InterMines which are not interconnected. Project BlueGenes aims to integrate all the sources and provide a single interface to access the data of all 30 InterMines.<br>
This project aims to develop a javascript based tool which will be embedded on BlueGenes list pages (which can be of genes or proteins). This tool will allow users to find similarities between different genes or proteins that are provided in the list. In order to enable this, we’ll make an explorable graph visualization of the relationships between InterMine entities (proteins or genes). Each entity or object will be represented as a node.<br>
The idea is that visualizing things helps us to spot patterns. So, we’ll have this tool, which will visualize the interactions and similarities between different entities and there will be options to tweak the appearance/structure to make things more explorable.

11,AMRITA: an online database for herbal medicine,"Anunya Opasawatchai, David Chentanaman",Holger Dinkel,"In South East Asia, herbal medicine has been used over the century as preventive and therapeutics intervention. However, due to the scarcity of scientific evidence, the use of herbal medicines is limited to local wisdom. Several constraints such as the absence of funding, patent issues, and most importantly, the lack of modern scientific approaches have prevented the pathway to this gold mine of drug discovery. Here, we propose the development of AMRITA, an online web-based library of medicinal herbs that include their phylogeny, medicinal properties, known active components and related scientific literatures that is open publicly to the research community world-wide. This platform would facilitate the collaboration of researchers across the fields of biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical sciences in establishing a solid foundation of medicinal plants and enabling the use of these plants in modern medicine.

More importantly, I would like to design an efficient communication strategy to bring this relevant content to young PIs in a way that saves them time and energy. This would first require understanding what PIs most needed when they started (and therefore which already existing resources are actually useful), and how it should be delivered to them - in which form, through which channels (e.g. young PIs newsletter), at what time(s). Then, I would like to curate existing content, repackage it in an easily accessible and “digestable” form, add to it, but also create readily usable tools (e.g. templates - not just things people have to read). Topics would include how to work openly and inclusively (e.g. lab codes of conduct, lab manuals, leading inclusive meetings, setting up a healthy lab culture etc.); how to do research open (preprints, toolkits with software to work open, project management tools etc.); how to train the next generation of open scientists; and how to open your work to the public. Finally, I would like to approach organisations and institutions to help more young PIs get access to these resources.

Our mission is to provide scientists with open software, data, and computing that improves development of productive and sustainable agricultural systems. One of our persistent hurdles has been enabling and motivating the community to use our software and data.<br>
To address this, our project will focus on improving documentation for data and software that our group develops, as well as identifying and sharing best practices with the broader community. We will include the <a href=""https://docs.terraref.org/"">TERRA REF project</a>, which produces high-resolution sensor data on crop plants, and the <a href=""https://osf.io/xdkcy/wiki/home/"">drone pipeline</a>, which automates steps in the use of drones to study crops. Both projects produce open data (CC0 and CC-BY) and software (MIT/BSD compatible).<br>
Our goal is to make our products more usable for our intended audience, which is primarily scientists across a range of disciplines from computer science to remote sensing. We plan to have each person in the group complete a sub-project that can be finished in 15 weeks. Each sub-project would result in an accompanying blog post describing the best practices implemented.

Aside from Jupyter notebooks, gitlab, and a few platforms that focus on data storage and linear processing paths, it can be hard to find platforms where researchers can safely collaborate with real transparency, while sharing as they go through a data collection lifecycle the actual workflows of their open science practices. I work already with an open-source project that provides these tools, but our platform can be challenging to adopt for new projects without dedicated technical resources, given the depth of knowledge and time required.<br>
My objective for this project is to begin tackling this from a few angles, including documentation, publication, and nudges in our code development process. I believe it is feasible in this timeline to also pilot open tools with a new project or as an extension to an existing project -- to start putting this idea into action. What problem(s)

The main goal would be to design a website (e.g., through GitHub) that would contain different chapters on how to accomplish different open science achievements (e.g., designing a Code of Conduct for collaboration, developing a data management plan, setting up an Open Lab Notebook) and that could be easily cloned to their personal websites and modified for their specific purposes. As an extension, I am hoping that this could then be expanded into a university course for undergraduate and/or graduate students or even as a workshop that could be help at different education centers, museums, or conferences. Not only would this allow junior faculty to get on the right foot of developing an open and inclusive lab, it would also help train the next generation of open scientists who trained under the faculty member. By making these resources freely available, it would also help maintain open lines of communication between lab members and make sure that expectations of the faculty mentor and student / staff mentees are fully transparent so that the mentoring process can be improved for science mentees.

27,Using collective action to change cultural norms and drive progress in the life sciences,Cooper Smout,"Luis Pedro Coelho, Lilian Juma","Open Science practices have the potential to benefit everyone in the life
science community (and broader society), but their adoption is limited by
incentive structures that reward ‘fast’ and unreliable science at the
individual level. ‘Crowd-acting’ platforms (e.g., Kickstarter, Collaction)
can overcome such collective action problems by organising ‘pledges’ for a
particular behaviour, which are only acted on if and when a predetermined
critical mass of support is met. By protecting individuals’ interests until
such time that they have the support of their community, crowd-acting
platforms can thus resolve the collective action problem and increase the
uptake of the beneficial behaviour in question. Similarly, Project Free Our
Knowledge aims to organise collective action in the global research
community. Researchers can create and sign campaigns asking their peers to
adopt a new behaviour, but only act on that pledge if a certain threshold
of support is met (e.g., 1000 signatures). If and when the threshold is
reached, everyone who has signed that campaign will be listed on the website
and directed to carry out the new behaviour in unison, with the protection

33,Science For All (Sci4All) - Citizens' daily problem solving by engaging multidisciplinary scientific communities,"Teresa Laguna, Laura Judith Marcos-Zambrano",Katharina Lauer,"The project concept is to establish a collaboration between the general
public and scientists, where the citizens can expose their daily issues and
scientists can collaborate to try to find solutions for them. For that purpose,
we aim to establish a multidisciplinary scientific network who help citizens
to improve their daily life.
To start the project, we think it is more appropriate to first create
local communities, starting in Madrid as it the location of the applicants.
In the future, the local network can be expanded or occasionally contact
other local communities, such as the ones already established by means of
this program (Barcelona, Utrecht, Montreal), to work collaboratively in
global public issues. Connections with companies can also be established
(for example, to help in the production of prototypes) but with the
requirement of use open licenses and follow the precepts of this program.

pre-prints and publications on COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds,
scientists are working round-the-clock to generate data, resulting in an
upsurge of information on various aspects of the virus. Various publishers
such as Lancet, Elsevier, Oxford, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
Nature, have open access early journal releases and publications on a wide
range of fields covering the COVID-19 topic. Many efforts are still underway
to develop a feasible vaccine with trials taking place at different research
centers globally. An open repository of open access pre-prints and journal
articles in the area of COVID-19 immunology and vaccinology will easily
connect researchers on current data available for efficient communication
of scientific research and open science principles. The repository will be
divided into subsections of publications from the 7 continents to be able
to easily identify how the disease is affecting different geographical

about 3D modeling methods for biomechanics. This sparked the idea of creating
some sort of online database of workflows in our field. This website will
serve early career researchers or researchers starting out with biomechanical
analyses, or those wishing to switch their workflows (for example to be more
freeware based). Currently there is a need for a central repository of such
workflows. Usually they are only circulated within lab groups or between
collaborators. However, an online hub with modeling resources would
significantly reduce the time researchers need to invest in choosing
programs and figuring out how to set up their models, giving them more
time to do research and develop new methods. For this project, we
specifically want to build a website with open source workflows, tips and
tricks for setting up models for finite element analysis, as well as other
3D workflows (such as fossil reconstruction in freeware programs).

meeting space where students in Montreal can come throughout the year
to get help making their research more open and reproducible. This
initiative will promote Open Education in life science, particularly in
the area of neuroimaging data science. Students in this field often learn
hard skills in open science at weekend workshops, summer schools, and
hackathons, but there is a gap in the learning experience regarding
long-term support. The main measurable outcome of this project would be
having a group of senior trainees who take turns hosting Open-Science
office hours at regular intervals throughout the year. These meetings
would take place virtually and/or in person in Montreal, Canada (depending
on COVID-19).
Although we hope to spark this initiative, it would need community support
to be sustainable. In the first stage, I would welcome collaborators to
help plan. Later, we would need support in the form of funding so that we
can compensate TA’s; this would help enable less-privileged trainees to get
involved as TA's. Finally, we would need to recruit the TA's. Thus, this
project will involve community contributions at all stages, in various capacities.

38,Registered Reports in Primate Neurophysiology,Danny Garside,Ivo Jimenez,"In this new project I aim to explore the specific challenges (both
practical and metascience related) to adoption of registered reports in
primate neurophysiology. As far as we aware there has not yet been a
registered report within the field of non-human-primate (NHP)
neurophysiology. There are specific challenges for using this format
within this field; some practical and some metascientific. A central issue
is that the existing format for registered reports focuses on hypothesis
testing, whereas neurophysiology is quite often an exploratory and
iterative process. Working with NHPs is a necessarily limited privilege
and comes with considerable responsibility; the cost of having experiments
where the results are not robust, or where opportunities for discovery
are missed, is particularly high, since opportunity for replication is
limited. Therefore, peer review in advance of performing an experiment
seems a particularly valuable idea. This project would explore ways in
which to find compromise in the conflict between existing registered
report formats and current methodologies in primate neurophysiology.

life sciences as part of their curriculum. There’s, however, a difference
in accessibility to resources. There are a number of science clubs in
these universities. In light of the recent pandemic, there has been a
change in how conferences and science events are being conducted, which
has proven that online training is an effective mode of training and so is
remote distribution of resources. With increasing need to adopt online
trainings and conferences, and to narrow the gap in distribution of
resources to different institutions and also encourage collaboration,
I propose a platform that contains data of all science clubs in Kenyan
institutions. The platform will allow submissions of training needs from
the different institutions to allow narrowed down preparation and it will
also allow collaboration of students from various institutions. From
requests obtained, organization of talks and trainings can be more

develop customized automation equipment. Inspired by assembly lines, the
concept consists of ready-to-use and customizable hardware modules which
can be plugged into the base frame. In contrast to current commercial and
open-source standalone solutions, this concept enables the combination of
single hardware modules – each with a specific set of functionalities – to
a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup.
The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed
to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications,
including pipetting operations for non-viscous and viscous liquids and
transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules.
The successful application of this concept is presented within a case study
by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies
and a crosslinker module to initiate polymerization of hydrogel solutions.
By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a
modular technology platform, this concept has the potential to facilitate
the development of customized automation equipment for efficient and
reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, the
OpenWorkstation concept will allow empower academic groups to the develop
their own equipment to automated their research workflows.

48,Towards open and citizen-led data informing the decarbonisation of existing housing,Kate Simpson,Arielle Bennett,"The Design for Retrofit project I work on at The Alan Turing Institute,
within the Data-Centric Engineering programme aims to use data-driven methods
to address uncertainty in design stage decision-making towards reducing the
carbon impact of homes through retrofit. This involves quantification of the
current energy demand of housing archetypes and physics-based modelling to
evaluate the impact of energy-efficiency technologies available to be installed
in the home during the retrofit process. However, uncertainty exists due to a
lack of monitored data on indoor air temperature, which leads to a performance
gap between modelled and monitored energy demand as heating practices are the
most sensitive parameter within building energy modelling. Further uncertainty
is acknowledged due to a lack of longitudinal data following retrofit. Such
data could inform the evaluation of long-term impacts of technologies installed,
to inform future decision making. Motivated householders who are planning or
recently completed a retrofit project might be interested to share data, perhaps
in return for research insight on the impacts and success of similar projects
through a citizen science approach. This is an idea in development for follow-on

52,Best practices for online collaboration/peer-production in citizen science,Katharina Kloppenborg,Fotis Psomopoulos,"Citizen science revolves around the idea of integrating the public in scientific research. However, there are different interpretations of this idea. An important part of citizen science projects allows laymen only to participate in a limited scope of microtasks and keeps thus reinforcing the power gap between academic scientists and the public. Literature has called for more autonomy of citizen scientists by allowing them to participate in more phases of the research cycle. Commons-based peer-production, an alternative mode of production in which people self-organize to develop complex knowledge-commons like Wikipedia or open software, seems to be a promising approach to facilitate this. However, a design-centred approach implementing this for a specific use case is yet to be done. In my PhD project I am trying to fill this gap by redesigning the online ecosystem of Open Humans - an existing community of practice around citizen science - collaborating closely with this community in a user-centered design approach.

Despite it is a relatively young discipline, its prominence in the life sciences is becoming more and more popular. Within the scope of my project, I aim to evaluate the paper on molecular biology studies and make them available for everyone. Choosing a weekly topic and summarizing it that everyone can understand is the main idea. As a workflow, I aim to write a brief introduction to introduce the paper and its authors, the purpose of the study, and present the results. Briefly, I would like to design a website which is publicly accessible. I aim to make this website as a resource for the academic community, students and all other folks who want to read and learn. At the same time, I plan to prepare a section where questions can be asked in order to share with other readers to make a discussing community about the related article. I want to provide a connection between students or researchers in this field of science to improve knowledge, share and even find new ideas.",3,"open educational resource, open-collaborative, molecular biology",graduated,

I am a graduand of OLS-2 that recently concluded and coming out of that program I felt that there is tremendous value in the program. However, this might not be reaching out to as many as possible. I think, one way of the extending the outreach beyond what else has been done is perhaps to pen down the experience of the participants of the previous program. As a participant myself, I can see how there many ways, one could promote this and share the journey with the readers, especially with the young generation and highlight the essence of this program.

The goal of this project is to improve sktime’s online documentation with a specific focus on documenting algorithm contributors. Algorithms form a major part of sktime. They require special expertise in their development and maintenance. We plan to enhance the existing documentation by making algorithm contributors more visible. The aim is (i) to make it easier for users and other developers to directly get in touch with the algorithm experts to ask questions or suggest code improvements and (ii) to recognize their contributions more visibly and formally to encourage long-term maintenance of their contributions. sktime has already defined a new community role as part of their governance guidelines to ensure that algorithm contributors have extra rights and responsibilities with regard to their algorithm. However, up-to-date documentation listing the current contributors and links to their algorithms is currently missing. Optionally, we can add other information like literature references.

Diverse laboratory procedures, analyses and identification criteria are used resulting from different research traditions. Some steps, such as the normalisation of nomenclature through the International Phytolith Society, have been promoted to standardise the phytolith analysis and the subsequent publication of data. However, the standardisation of phytolith research and data publication is still far from being achieved. Moreover, a recent assessment of the data sharing practices within the phytolith community found only half of the publications share some form of data and the majority do not provide reusable data. This project has grown from initial efforts by Emma Karoune during OLS2 to raise awareness of issues with poor data sharing practice. It is part of a broader initiative supported by the International Phytolith Society on data sharing and represents the first steps towards the FAIRification of phytolith data: an evaluation of sharing practices in phytolith research; the creation of a GitHub repository for collaborative use by this working group and in the forthcoming FAIRification project; and the development of a webpage to provide the community with information as the project proceeds.",3,"FAIR, data sharing, palaeobotany, phytolith research, archaeology, palaeoecology",graduated,

Obesity is an outcome of complex, heritable, and multi-factorial interaction of multiple genes, environmental factors, and behavioral traits that makes management and prevention challenging in the human population (Rao et al., 2014). Experimental research has demonstrated that altered metabolites in multiple metabolic pathways are associated with obesity (Zhao et al.,2016). Alteration in the proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the gut microbiome can trigger obesity. The gut microbiome's influence on obesity is much more complicated than the imbalance of these bacteria species. Modulation of the gut microbiome through diet, prebiotics, surgery, and antibiotics significantly affects the obesity epidemic (John & Mullin, 2016). It is one of the enormous global health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality mediated by its association with several other metabolic disorders (Saini et al., 2018).

At CONABIO (Mexico), a governmental agency that coordinates biodiversity data collection, I collaborate in the development of an Agrobiodiversity Information System (SIAgroBD); my role involves technical and community management responsibilities. Currently, twelve teams of students and researchers from different institutions contribute to field data collection for SIAgroBD. While we are committed to open practices at CONABIO and all collected data are open, some external contributors lack the skills to use these data, even if they have helped collect them, and are not familiar with open practices. Thus my project consists in developing training materials (OER) for an introductory workshop on open data with a focus on FAIR principles, biodiversity standards, effective management strategies, among other skills that encourage contributors to become active users of data apart from collectors. The integration of social and biological information and the use of Indigenous data are distinctive features of agrobiodiversity research in Mexico that will also be addressed.

The project aims to use the methods of empirical legal scholarship to describe and categorize the ways postdoctoral scholars and their appointments have been involved in the legal system. Briefly, empirical legal scholarship is a form of qualitative or mixed-methods research, often involving content analysis, that uses legal documents or decisions as its data source. We are not aware of any other research applying this method or data source to the study of postdocs.  In fact, there has been little research of any kind on the legal aspects of postdoc appointments.

Building on a “file drawer” paper by Jennifer Miller (with Kristina Van Buskirk), we frame our project around the question of whether postdocs are employees or students. Based on economic theory, we expect the types of cases to reflect whether postdocs are employees producing in a labor market or students consuming in a services market.

Our method for the creation of these language resources is as follows: 
 
 Nigerian Sentiment Corpus: To create the sentiment corpus, tweets from major Nigerian news headlines for each of the three languages will be crawled from Twitter using an existing Python crawler we developed. Ten thousand tweets will be extracted per language via the Twitter API. Thereafter, the tweets will be annotated by native annotators for each of the languages. These annotators will be hired and trained to perform the annotation. The annotation tasks consist of labeling each tweet as either positive, negative or neutral.To mitigate errors and bias, each dataset will be annotated by three different annotators. After which the project team will compute the kappa agreement between the annotators
 
 Nigerian Sentiment Lexicon: In the same way, manual annotation of the tweets will be used to create the sentiment lexicon for each of the three languages. The sentiment lexicon annotation task involves Identifying sentiment bearing words from each tweet and assigning a sentiment score between +1 to +5 (with 1 being the most negative sentiment and +5 the most positive sentiment).
 
 Nigerian Hate Speech Lexicon: Extreme negative sentiment from the sentiment lexicon will be used to develop the hate speech lexicon. 
 
 Annotation tool: We plan to use a web-based annotation tool, brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012) which has been proved to be efficient for this type of task by many researchers. The annotators must be native speakers of the language and follow the annotation guidelines provided by the project teams.

I will rework these interviews into blog posts and analyse what I learnt from these interviews. The interviews will focus on the following elements:
1.	What is their background, how did they enter this job?
2.	What is expected from them in this role?
3.	What is their role/position within the landscape of RDM and Open Science support at their institution?
4.	What skills and competencies do they already have?
5.	What skills and competencies would they like or need to acquire?
6.	What does a possible career path look like for them?

I will analyse these interviews to make suggestions about necessary training for new generic data stewards, why (and how) they are necessary for the institution, and their possible career paths. We have a blog about the RDM Community at the VU, which is meant to showcase the RDM Community. This is a possible location for my blogs and other progress made in the project.",4,"data stewards, research community, interview",,

Software and programming plays an important part of most of the research in these times. Yet, academia has not fully adopted good modern software practices and principles. We also plan to create an awareness of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) role in Asian academia so that people who have an expertise in software as well as research find a firm footing in academia. The plan in this project is to first build a community of interested people. We would also like to build the technical set-up required for this project like a GitHub repository for easy collaboration; a website which would describe the aims of this association, and would include information on further events of this association; a mailing list which people can use to join this association easily, a Twitter account, and a slack channel in the global RSE slack.

98,Encouraging Responsible AI Through An Open Framework for Synthetic Data Generation and Assessment,"Erika Salomon, Caitlin Augustin",Fotis Psomopoulos,"Operating from a place of data for co-liberation, we have three complementary goals: conduct a landscape analysis of open source synthetic data projects, ask critical questions about the embedded assumptions and ethical considerations in generating synthetic data, and recommend appropriate approaches to synthetic generation for multiple case studies. 

We see an urgent need for this work - while methodologies have become more common in the financial policy realm, most applied data researchers outside of large financial or tech companies do not have access to - nor an understanding of - the state of the art approaches, how to evaluate appropriateness of generation for their use cases, and how to evaluate synthetic data fitness for use. 

We are expressly sector-agnostic, bringing expertise from health, environment, and education backgrounds to this problem - all sectors with a need for privacy-protecting solutions. Building on sector-agnostic frameworks such as Datasheets for Datasets, and the very recent CDEI-UK PETs Adoption Guide we aim to deliver a similarly sector-agnostic framework for synthetic data generation. With our interdisciplinary background, we will approach the development of such a framework in a way that acknowledges the political nature of data production and openly consider questions of bias, fairness, and ethical AI.",4,"synthetic data, Ethical AI",,

For example, “Data visualization using Python”, or “Digital Fabrication with FreeCAD”. We have hosted two cycles of 4 workshops spanning 1 month, with both software and hardware tools, as well as two stand-alone events about design heuristics with a local fablab.

The goal of this project is to find common problems within Latin American scientific communities and hold workshops and training courses to tackle these problems. Each of these workshops serve as a way to connect people facing the same problem, introduce them to open source tools and concepts, and enable sharing resources. We hope attendees finish each workshop with a concrete first impression about the method and hands-on experience with the tool to reduce the barrier to adoption.",4,"training and education, data visualisation, research community",graduated,

This hub is a virtual platform linked to TDM to support academics (particularly young Female researchers), scientists, and physicians. It aims to bridge the boundaries between research, cross-subject collaboration, and establish a community of like-minded people. It will work towards increasing the visibility of ECRs and invite them to apply Open Science practices in their reserach. A part of this Research Hub is to establish a Citizen Science Soil Collection program in Saudi Arabia. This project aims to adapt the Citizen Science approach in Saudi Arabia to bring together researchers with citizens. Our lab focus is the use of metagenomics of Natural Products (NPs) and it is based on King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC). Metagenomics of NPs is an innovative approach that utilizes next-generation sequencing to study microorganisms via the analysis of their DNA acquired directly from an environmental sample. The screening of natural product extracts has traditionally been the most effective method for identifying new compounds with unique cellular targets which are potentially useful as lead structures for the development of new therapeutics. 

However, there is hardly any known project which utilises Citizen Science in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we are collaborating with Open Science community Saudi Arabia (OSASA) to adapt this approach in our current project. This project will engage citizen scientists in collecting and examining soil samples from various regions in Saudi Arabia and bring awareness about the role of Citizen Science in research as  part of the Research Hub.",4,"citizen science, therapeutics, soil sample, sequencing, metagenomics",graduated,
103,Developing a library in Python for applying measures of emergence and complexity,Nadine Spychala,"Dario Pescini, Anthony Bretaudeau","I aim to develop a Python library which allows to call and apply several measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated data, and provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures. &nbsp;

Measures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e., parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two). &nbsp;

Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite substantially in the last couple of decades,  quantifying emergence is completely new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf, or https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289), but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), programming languages (including Matlab which is not open source). &nbsp;

We monitor and communicate ongoing developments within the open research landscape, provide guidance and training on adopting open practices, and influence incentive structures to recognise commitment to open research practices.

The aim of the *EROS Stories* project is to deepen EROS as a community of practice by providing a mechanism for junior and senior researchers to engage in dialogue about their experiences with particular open research practices, and to showcase the resulting conversations as publicly available case studies.

Concretely, *EROS Stories* will pair researchers, at least one of whom must be an ECR, and at least one of whom must have experience with a particular research practice. The less experienced partner (who may be senior) commits to reading at least one primer on a particular open research practice, and then leads a conversation with their partner, asking about their experiences, motivations, and insights and top tips for working with the practice.

However, currently it is orientated towards issues encountered mostly in Data Science, and while many of the resources are extendable towards other fields, I consider that it could benefit from specific chapters focused on different research areas. The aim of this project is to create such a chapter by understanding the exact barriers for young researchers when considering reproducible research in Decision Sciences.

In this project, I will be working on already collected survey data from their 3 cohorts. In my opinion, in this era, barriers to open research are not technical but rather socio-cultural. Therefore, by analyzing OLS participant’s survey data, we could gain insight into the demography and socio-culture of the participants. In this way, both OLS team will get a chance to enhance their program for the future and I will learn how to perform data analysis, deal with the survey data and gain some programming skills as well.

Its professional river education has the ambition to change the reality by creating a strong center/network of modern knowledge, linking experts and giving the opportunity to participants to learn about the peculiarities of different rivers in the Baltic region and in Europe.
We provide tools to use in practice, exchange information and experience about inland waters and its impact on the Baltic Sea, to spark joint initiatives for the sake of rivers’ good condition.
Riverine topics always reflect source-to-sea approach and relation to current trends, challenges, legislation regarding freshwaters, and free-flowing rivers: restore nature law, UN restoration decade, Biodiversity strategy 2030, European Green Deal, national recovery plans, etc.
In 2018, the River University mostly served for the purpose of gathering river experts from several transboundary basins of Poland (Odra, Vistula/Western Bug, Neman) with their counterparts from Belarus and Ukraine to discuss i.a. issues related to inland navigation and large infrastructure projects on straightening river flows in these countries. 1st edition of River University in 2020 provided general solid knowledge about healthy rivers, their benefits and threats, presented one of the most stunning rivers in Poland – Drawa river and highlighted current riverine challenges impacting the society. All these looking towards European community goals, as usual.

During the 2nd edition in 2021, we swim into Lithuania’s waters, to dive deep – finally live! – into water challenges in the next country in the Baltic region. We will get to know best practices of good water management, experience with transboundary river cooperation, also innovations and developments within sewerage system management. We can already read about flood risk management and about river barriers to remove or mitigate in the Baltic Sea Region (https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_flood-risk-management-in-the-baltic-sea-region_2021.pdf, https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_report_dam_removal_april_2021.pdf). This time we ask – how are the Lithuanian rivers?
Being a visitor of the largest protected area in Lithuania, crossing rivers outdoor, stepping into practical lectures in the national park, we will also ask about how to limit riverine pollution from tourism and how the connectivity of amazing Lithuanian rivers is ensured.
Checking the European background: how the situation of rivers in Europe looks like in general? Later in time, I may widen it to Europe, not only the Baltic region.

The goal is to popularise and raise local researchers' awareness of open science practices and platforms and thus to tackle the existing structural barriers (e.g., linguistic, epistemic, etc.) in accessing the information and disseminating the research from Central Asia. Currently, the local scholarship is located - geographically, linguistically, epistemically - in the global periphery which hinders the knowledge production, use, and dissemination in the region. Many scholars, as the result, become trapped in fraudulent research and publication practices. Moreover, there are cases when openly accessible educational resources are offered to researchers as a marketable product. So, to address these and other issues related to inaccessibility of knowledge production infrastructure, this project aims to create an openly accessible, fair, and multilingual educational resource about open science with the particular focus on Central Asia.

Homogeneous catalysts are important in many of our daily processes, but also in our fight against climate change. Our goal was to create a tool that can automatically generate large datasets that can be used in research for data-driven catalyst discovery.

The issue was that a simple SMILES representation of a molecular scaffold does not work when it contains a transition metal complex. With this tool we use the 3D coordinates of a molecular scaffold and let the user place molecular fragments to create many variations of this scaffold. Other inorganic chemistry fields that use transition-metal containing molecules might benefit from this tool as well. A first prototype is published, but several things can be done to increase the usability of our tool.",5,"software, homogeneous catalysis, data-driven chemistry, chemical space, transition, metal complexes, open-source",graduated,

These models can be accessed with little to no-coding expertise, solving a major roadblock in the applicability of such technologies to day-to-day research. The Hub currently includes a hundred open source models, both from the literature and developed by the [Ersilia organization](https://ersilia.io). With this project, we aim to open the Hub to the whole computer science community, encouraging third-author model depositions so that the code they develop is not simply open source but also deployed in a user-friendly manner. By leveraging the Hub architecture, computer scientists can reach more users, interact with them and further the impact of the assets they have developed by facilitating its implementation in real case scenarios. To this end, the project will focus on establishing clear guidelines on the quality of the software and its reproducibility (as it won't necessarily be yet peer-reviewed) and creating a standard model deposition form and minimum required documentation.

I am also privileged in that I am able to comfortably speak and read English.   Unfortunately, a large percentage of our country has a very poor level of education, often not being able to read or speak English very well. Most South African resources I have found for individuals with, and parents of children with, autism are only available in English. My project aims to create a database of resources in a variety of South African languages, both written and as a video format (due to poor literacy rates, especially among older generations due to historical discrimination), in easy to understand language and with concepts that are easy to grasp.

They build *Communities of Practice* around the project through knowledge exchange, maintenance or development practices and ultimately guide the future directions for both the projects and their communities. To build a more equitable, resilient and sustainable open infrastructure for a diverse community, it is important to select governance models that give voices to people (users, contributors and wider society) from different socio-technical and socio-cultural backgrounds, identities, career stages, contextual needs and   research communities.  The Turing Way is a guide for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research and data science. Open Life Science is a training and mentoring program to help researchers learn and apply open principles in their work. They are mission-aligned open science projects that involve participants from around the world to create something deeply meaningful for them. The Turing Way has grown exponentially in the last three years that offers more than 200 pages co-created by more than 300 contributors. Open Life Science has offered 4 cohorts in the last 2 years and currently supports a community of over 300 members (present and past mentees, mentors and experts).  To support the governance work in these projects in 2022, I would like to carry out a systematic study of governance models suitable for decentralised and distributed communities such as these. By creating a portfolio of governance models suitable for projects at different maturity levels, members from these projects will be able to identify the right model for their respective  projects.

During the OLS program, we aim to build an open community around Hub23 to help to guide future technical developments, and encourage use and contributions from the wider Turing community. We will host a series of Zero-to-Binder workshops aimed at introducing Turing researchers to regular binder, followed by structured discussion of what the ideal features of a collaborative reproducible environment for research would be.

Cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent among the group of treatable diseases in African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 10% of histopathology needs are met and this is a major barrier to comprehensive management of cancers

1. There is a shortage of clinicians and pathologists available for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the critical factors in treatment efficiency is the correct and timely diagnosis of specimens by pathologists. However, there is currently a significant shortage of cancer care clinicians in Africa and an even more considerable shortage of pathologists. In Cameroon, there are 19 pathologists currently in practice for 22,179,707 inhabitants
2. The absolute number of patients with cancer in Cameroon was estimated to be 25,000 cases a year.

Diagnosis of cancer relies on histology in nearly 80% of cases, cytology in 10%, and clinical diagnosis in 10% (1). There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of   cancers, to increase cancer treatment efficacy and reduce overtreatment of tumors clinically suspicious for malignancy.   We propose a hybrid diagnosis method with a deep Learning algorithm applied on hematoxylin and eosin histology slides. Digital microscopy and telepathology were already successfully used to mitigate the lack of pathologists in Cameroon, thus confirming the availability of a robust dataset for our project (1). Following splitting into training, validation and test sets, we will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm before deployment and tests. In addition to automated diagnostic, the developed program will have specific features such as sample information storage and tracking software as well as image optimization and analysis tools.

Majority of the focus on mental health is in capacity building for mental health research or offering sustainable mental healthcare. The lack of conversations around how students undertaking research fail to complete projects or progress beyond certain levels in research shines a bright light on the intensity of neglect on the mental health of researchers.  It is therefore paramount to create awareness and avail tools catered to researchers needs. The project focus is to develop an open online support resource for primary mental health catered to researchers particularly scientific researchers. This platform will contain educational materials concerning emotional health which sits at the core of mental health. It will also contain self-assessment tools and techniques for developing mental resilience. In addition to that, the resource will contain a peer support network that will offer help and emotional support.

This project is driven by the growing need for RSE's by researchers, as research is becoming increasingly reliant on data-driven technologies, and within the academic community itself, there is an emphasis on providing reusable, reproducible data which is not a skill that most researchers have. By creating a semantic overview of the interaction between skills, technologies and the key role-players in the RSE community, this ontology will be able to provide information on the research fields that each RSE has background knowledge in, their development skills, and the services that they are willing to provide clients, enabling a way in which suitable RSEs can be assigned to projects where they will be able to provide software development and software-development-related assistance.

At the hackathon, participants can either come up with their own problem statements or chose one to work on from our list. The questions will focus on: (1) difficulties that prevent them from fully implementing and practicing some or all aspects of OS in their science networks/ institutions/universities, and (2) problems that can be solved through OS. OILS will provide support to the participants by tapping into the OS  network in Switzerland and introducing them to necessary experts and tools. An example of such a problem could be the absence of a searchable data repository in their university that contains links to all published datasets from the participating research groups - such an infrastructure would encourage the generation and sharing of well-annotated data. At the end of the event, ideally, the participants would have actionable steps and solutions that either can be directly implemented by them or proposed to competent authorities.

In 2009, FIFA adopted MRI as an age determination tool for its youth level competitions but recent studies show that bone age assessment has a very large margin of error and cannot be a standard for determining apparent age when we know that environmental factors greatly influence the development of the child. There are populations in which the disappearance of growth cartilage is 4 to 5 years earlier than in another. The ugly face of the problem is that many children are born out of the healthcare system.  In Cameroon, approximately 1.7 million children, or 66 %, do not have a birth certificate. These children are said to be ""invisible"" In other words, they live without being recognised by the country whose citizenship they claim.  According to a study carried out by Unicef, 40,000 children, in the Far North region alone, will find it difficult to present their end of year First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) for lack of a birth certificate. To establish these birth certificates, it will be necessary to make an estimate of their apparent age in a complex process which discourages parents. It is evident that the determination of apparent age should not only be seen from a clinical standpoint. Instead, socio-cultural and environment factors must also be taken into account.

187,Ethical Implications of Open Source AI: Transparency and Accountability,Gift Kenneth,Isil Poyraz Bilgin,"Exploring the ethical implications of open-source AI is a topic that deals with understanding the potential consequences of making AI systems and their underlying data and algorithms available to the public.   One of the main ethical implications of using AI is that it can potentially lead to bias and discrimination, as the data and algorithms used to train these systems may reflect societal biases. Additionally, open data could also raise concerns about data privacy, as the release of sensitive data could lead to negative consequences for individuals and organizations.  However, open source AI can also be used to promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. Making the data and algorithms used to train AI systems publicly available, allows for greater oversight and monitoring of these systems to ensure that they are not being used in unethical or harmful ways. Additionally, open source AI can also foster community development and collaboration, allowing for transparency, a wider range of perspectives and expertise to be brought to bear on the development and use of AI.

It may vary with additives aimed at optimizing and improving the drilling process(Sadiq et al., 2003). They are mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds applied to cool and lubricate the drill bit; clean the borehole bottom; drive cuttings to the surface, control formation pressure and improve the function of the drill string and tools in the borehole (API, 1992).   The decline of the environment is presently a common and overwhelming challenge globally (Gazali et al., 2017). Studies have shown that uncontrolled disposal of drilling fluid wastes, with accompanying toxic components contribute heavily to the diminishing biodiversity (Vincent-Akpu, 2015; Vincent-Akpu and Sikoki, 2013; Sil et al., 2012). Most drilling firms especially on-shore, prefer to use land spraying (or throwing) as a method of disposing the waste drilling muds. Such unsustainable methods could lead to some hostile environmental impacts (Gazali et al., 2017). Yet, if biodegradation is relied on as a natural and cost-effective option for pollutant breakdown and pollution control (Nrior et al., 2017).  The aim of this study is to investigate the biodegradability of drilling fluid in the different soil types. This study, in addition to specifying the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil, will chiefly show which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability and by implication provide reliable data for policy makers as regards to environmental reclamation",7,"Biodegradability, Drilling Fluid, Soil, Petroleum Hydrocarbons",,

To prevent voltage overloading, the grid power system must undergo rapid changes to maintain stability. The Swing equation is widely used for stability analysis, but its classical model may lead to erroneous conclusions. A modified Swing equation with forced oscillation and nonlinear damping is proposed, using the Lagrangian of the system derived from the maximum entropy principle. Statistical Mechanics preserves the Swing equation for power systems subjected to forced oscillations. The modified Swing equation is numerically integrated for various external load conditions, including constant, step, periodic, and stochastic loads. The steady state and transient stability of the system are determined by the load nature, magnitude, and damping.",8,"Wind Power, Fluctuation, Stability Analysis, Swing Equation, Statistical Mechanics, Grid Integration",,

221,Making corporate social responsibility data available and accessible for other researchers,Marlou Ramaekers,"Diana Pilvar, Gladys Rotich","Since 1995, the Center for Philanthropic Studies at VU Amsterdam has conducted a biennial survey measuring corporate social responsibility in the Netherlands. The survey includes questions on corporate philanthropy in the form of giving money, goods and services to charitable causes, sponsorships of organizations, corporate volunteering, and corporate social responsibility behavior, among other topics. The thirteen waves of data have been collected for the Giving in the Netherlands (“Geven in Nederland”) series, which reports macro-economic estimates of the size, composition and trends in philanthropy. The data are rich and unique; they contain extensive information about corporate giving, volunteering and social responsibility as well as background information for large samples of the for-profit landscape in the Netherlands (total n ≈ 12,000). The data have not been documented for external use. As a result, the data have unused potential. The goal of the current project is to make the data publicly available in line with the FAIR principles in a repository that can be used for future editions of the survey.",8,"Fair, Data Sharing, Survey Data, Philanthropy, Corporate Social Responsibility, Business Administration, Economics, Organization Science",,VU Amsterdam
222,Gender Differences in the Impostor Phenomenon: A Preregistered and Open-Science Meta-Analysis,"Bo Wang, Jacek Buczny, Wendy Andrews, Hans Ket, Reinout de Vries","Umut Pajaro Velasquez, Nina Trubanová","The impostor phenomenon (IP) refers to self-doubts about one’s abilities and difficulty internalizing individual accomplishments. These individuals attribute their success to external (e.g., oversight or luck), instead of internal (e.g., intelligence or competence) factors. Therefore, they are worried that they will be found out as intellectual frauds or “impostors”. This phenomenon was first described by Clance and Imes in 1978 and received great attention over the last decades. Although initial researchers suggested that especially women suffer from the impostor phenomenon, more recent empirical evidence regarding gender differences is mixed. The aim of the current meta-analysis is to examine whether or not there are gender differences in the impostor phenomenon to examine where these potential gender differences come from moderation and mediation analysis. When conducting the meta-analysis, we want to follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis for Protocols (PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015) and use the PRISMA-P templates developed by Moreau and Gamble (2022). We will preregister our study by uploading these templates (e.g., hypotheses, article searching strategies, screening criteria, codebook) and share all study materials and data via the Open Science Framework. We will also keep a logbook to track all details of our project.",8,"Gender, Impostor Feelings, Impostor Phenomenon, Impostor Syndrome, Mental Health, Meta-Analysis",,VU Amsterdam
223,Creating an online repository for open collaboration in psychology.,"Vasiliki Kentrou, Antonis Koutsoumpis, Bo Wang","Irene Vazano, Jesica Formoso, Patricia Loto","This project aims to develop an online repository to facilitate open collaboration in the field of psychology. The objective is to enable researchers from various locations to share their anonymized data on a centralized platform. The shared datasets will be made accessible to other researchers for further analysis. To accomplish this, the development of machine-readable codebooks is crucial. These codebooks - part of the present project - will enable the automated reading and merging of individual researchers' datasets, resulting in the creation of a comprehensive Giga database in psychology research.",8,"Database, Open Repository, Online Study, Surveys",,VU Amsterdam

225,UbuntuEdu (Concept title),"Roné Wierenga, Henk Wierenga","Tajuddeen Gwadabe, Joyce Kao","I aspire to develop an e-learning platform inspired by Udemy that specifically caters to African individuals, enabling them to upload courses in their native languages. The primary objective of this platform is to promote mother tongue education and offer e-learning opportunities for Africans seeking courses developed by their fellow Africans. Extensive research has consistently demonstrated the advantages of mother tongue education, such as increased literacy rates, enhanced critical thinking abilities, and elevated levels of cognitive processing. While my ultimate vision is to serve the entire African continent, I plan to initiate this endeavor by focusing on South African languages. Accomplishing this goal will entail fostering a sense of community, engaging with educators including teachers, lecturers, and professors, as well as actively involving the general public to encourage content creation and course material publication. While platforms like MijnNederlands have been successfully established for specific languages like Dutch, to the best of my knowledge, no such platform currently exists for African languages. Building this platform will undoubtedly be an immense undertaking, but upon completion of this mentorship program, my aim is to have developed the website and initiated the process of community building.",8,Mother Tongue Education; E-Learning; Education; Short Courses; Multilingualism,,Africa-OLS
226,"Building a Searchable Open Data Repository of DNA Collections that are Freely-Shared under OpenMTA, with an Associated Landscape Map Visualisation of the Collection Users","Yan-Kay Ho, Cibele Zolnier Sousa do Nascimento","Sara Villa, Mariela Rajngewerc","The documentation for the Open DNA Collections currently exist in multiple formats, and across three different platforms (the Open Bioeconomy Lab website, Freegenes website, and as collections on Addgene). Despite being a free and open resource, the dispersed nature of the available data makes it difficult for new users to understand which to use, and where to find the most up-to-date information. This project aims to gather all the disparate resources together, reformat the collections into a more standardised data structure, and produce a searchable/FAIR database on the Reclone.org website (the stewarding organisation) to make the collections more informative and accessible for new and old users alike. The outputs of this open data repository project will complement an existing Reclone project that aims to establish Regional Reagent Distribution Hubs in partner institutes (in Argentina, Ghana, and the Philippines) for sharing the physical DNA collections, and to help with capacity building within these institutes and local researchers. A parallel project goal would be to produce a landscape analysis and visualisation map of the current DNA Collections users to help future users in identifying local researchers within the Reclone community who may be able to better support their use of the collections.",8,"Dna Collections, Openmta, Fair, Database, Repository, Github, Visualisation, Mapping, Landscape Analysis, Open Communities, Open Bioeconomy, Open Enzymes, Molecular Diagnostics Toolkits, Synthetic Biology Toolkits, Capacity Building, Biotechnology",,
227,Developing an Open Community Repository for SciArt,Arianna Zuanazzi,Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal,"In recent years, the traditional dichotomy between art and science has been increasingly challenged by initiatives and programs (e.g., online resources, mixer programs, “SciArt” projects) that question the rigid definition of either field. These endeavours strive to establish a decentralised collaborative environment where artists and scientists can come together, encouraging them to reconsider and redefine their identities and practices. As part of the open science effort to make scientific data widely available, this project aims to create an Open Community Repository for deposition of raw scientific images. Scientific images are often not accessible to the general audience, educators, and visual artists whose work would benefit from images that portray real scientific spaces, methods, data, and discoveries. We envision that an open repository dedicated to raw scientific images could strengthen collaborations between artists and scientists and kickstart new SciArt partnerships.",8,"Science, Art, Sciart, Raw Images, Community Building, Open Access, Education, Outreach",,
228,Assessing word stability in Corpora and its influence on learner dictionaries,Mmasibidi Setaka,Riva Quiroga,"The task of assessing word stability in corpora through addition and removal of words is an important process which can influence which words should be in included or omitted in leaner dictionaries. The aim of the project is to investigate the stability of words in corpora when words are either removed or added, to gain insights into how word frequency distributions found in corpora have an influence on the outcome of learner’s dictionaries. The Oxford and McMillan dictionaries have top 3 000 words they deem important, and this project seeks to follow that example and assess the influence on word selection for learner dictionaries.",8,"Corpora, Dictionaries, Sesotho, Learners, Word Addition, Word Removal",,Africa-OLS
229,A Fiji plugin for SOFI analysis,Miyase Tekpinar,Diego Onna,Fluorescence microscopy has significantly contributed to our understanding of cellular processes in recent decades. The development of advanced super-resolution (SR) microscopy techniques has allowed for the examination of cellular structures at the nanoscale. SOFI (Super resolution optical fluctuation imaging method) is an SR method which uses the intensity fluctuations from single emitter and can provide higher resolution even using a couple of hundreds frame from wide-field image. However its analysis are mostly limited with scripted code and is not accessible enough of biologist. Creating an fiji plugin is important to help biologists and spread the method to different research fields.,8,"Sofi, Fiji, Super-Resolution, Microscopy",,
230,The invisible society: Misgendering in Facial Recognition Systems:,Elena Beretta,Bethan Iley,"Gender is a deeply ingrained constructs in human culture and societies. It permeates our everyday activities, whether real or virtual, from social interactions to our digital lives. By nature, the most significant aspects of culture are reflected in scientific progress, determining its development and evolution. The way technological change is shaped and structured is thus inherently grounded in societal norms and relations, which are themselves equally affected by technological transformations. In this sense, the relationship among technology and gender can be considered as mutually constitutive. This relationship is leading to at least two main consequences: i) individuals increasingly encounter representations of gender embedded in technology; ii) machines are being trained to recognize and react to relevant traits of human identity, including gender. These consequences are made even more evident by the increasingly pervasive use of Automatic Face Analysis Systems (AFAS), especially when those systems are based on face recognition. However, these systems are consistently built on a gender binary construct and almost never take into account non-binary individuals, causing exclusion and reinforce existing prejudices about these communities. The project will break this barrier by analysing how algorithms (un)recognize non-binary faces, to foster the development of inclusive, diverse and trustworthy AI.",8,"Face Recognition, Gender, Non-Binary, Identity, Ethics Of Ai",,VU Amsterdam
231,Identification and Prediction of Bacterial Pathogens Colonizing Yellowing Disease in Coastal Kenyan Coconuts: A Machine Learning Approach,Fatma Omar,Elisee Jafsia,"This project aims to investigate the diversity of bacterial pathogens associated with yellowing diseased coconuts along the Kenyan coast. The study will employ a combination of culture-independent methods and NGS techniques for bacterial identification. DNA extraction will be performed using CTAB method, followed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq platform. The obtained sequence data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 pipeline. To accurately detect and classify genetic variants, machine learning models including XgBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest will be trained using Python. The proposed research will shed light on the pathogenic bacteria associated with coconut diseases and facilitate the development of effective control measures.",8,"Coconut, Machine Learning, Next-Generation Sequencing, Bacterial Diversity",,OLS-Africa

233,An online repository of tools and methods for automated archaeological survey,Lucy Killoran,Bjørn Peare Bartholdy,"The aim of this project is to build an online repository which will improve accessibility to automated methods for detecting archaeological features in remote sensing data. The online repository will primarily act as a model garden for archaeological computer vision models, but will also contain example notebooks sharing basic workflows that can be reproduced. I have agreements in place with vision model developers that will allow me to build on their existing technical work to provide the initial set of models. This project is aimed at stakeholders who are (1) interested in gaining an overview of technical research, (2) interested in understanding what is involved in the technical implementation of automated methods, or (3) actively looking for models to apply in their own work. In its first iteration, the model garden will be focused on vision models for archaeological survey but could be expanded in the future to include models for application to different areas of archaeological practice. If possible, and if necessary for the first prototype of the repository, I would also like to collaborate with the Turing's Scivision project to build on their existing catalogue infrastructure to provide access to the models.",8,"Archaeology, Computational Archaeology, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Heritage Management, Geospatial, Landscape",,
