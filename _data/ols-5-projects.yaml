- description: The project *Multilingual Open Science* aims to create an open educational resource about FAIR research in Central Asian (CA) languages. The goal is to popularise and raise local researchers' awareness of open science practices and platforms and thus to tackle the existing structural barriers (e.g., linguistic, epistemic, etc.) in accessing the information and disseminating the research from Central Asia. Currently, the local scholarship is located - geographically, linguistically, epistemically - in the global periphery which hinders the knowledge production, use, and dissemination in the region. Many scholars, as the result, become trapped in fraudulent research and publication practices. Moreover, there are cases when openly accessible educational resources are offered to researchers as a marketable product. So, to address these and other issues related to inaccessibility of knowledge production infrastructure, this project aims to create an openly accessible, fair, and multilingual educational resource about open science with the particular focus on Central Asia. To this end, I am planning to use Jupyter Notebook and create a platform similar to [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome).

- description: 'Our initiative is called "Training Latin American scientists community to create high-quality open journals with good editorial standards". We intend to build a community of native spanish speaking scientists who teach and learn about creating editorial boards and open access scientific journals that meet international high editorial quality standards. We intend to organise hands-on workshops about different steps in the editorial process of creating scientific open access journals, with experienced trainers and with open source tools. Some of the topics we would like to cover are:

- Acquiring ISSN code for online journals,

- Acquiring plug-ins for displaying online journal view statistics,

- Implementing DOIs for scientific articles,

- Implementing Ithenticate to stop plagiarism in articles submitted to the OJS system.


These workshops would merge synchronic and asynchronic activities throughout  a period of 6 weeks, so that trainees get to learn all the necessary concepts through, familiarize with the required software and conceptualize and brainstorm solutions to the local needs for the journals they intend to develop, with peer support and mentoring.'

- description: There is a considerable gap in cases of sub-Saharan African countries regarding assessment of embodied energy of building materials and operational energy of various building types. Lack of data remains a critical barrier to closing this gap. Creating a database of embodied energy of building materials and operational energy of building typologies will be key in establishing the carbon footprint of buildings in Ghana. The development of an online platform will also allow interested groups, individuals and cooperation's to submit key information needed for the computation of energy outputs in buildings.  The aim of this project is to explore the scope and path towards establishing an open database and an inclusive community.

- description: "TU Delft OPEN Publishing, Open Access academic publisher of the TU Delft, publishes open access (OA) journals and open (text)-books. The OA journals currently receive not enough support regarding their development. This project aims to bring all OA journals to the same high level of quality expected of any TU Delft product.  This project will establish the identity of TU Delft OPEN Publishing as a trustworthy academic publisher within and beyond TU Delft.

The success of the plan is linked to the open collaboration of the journal editorial boards. The publishing plan will help journals

- Identify their readership by targeting the correct authors,

- Evaluate the quality of their publications (Impact),

- Determine their publishing priorities,

- Consider other publishing options (special Issues, new article types, publishing peer review comments, cascading),

- Growth,

- Improve communications and networking,

- Diversify the editorial board

- Take part in the education of young researchers


The plan needs to integrate as much as possible open science principles such as Open Data, Open peer review or authorship transparency in their publishing processes. While the plan will benefit all, It should consider the specificity of each journal. Overall the plan has to demonstrate its value to the editorial board."

- description: This project is envisioned as one that ends up as something that can explain the “why” when encouraging people from legal backgrounds to learn R and some data science. A case for open and reproducible research in a field that does not typically use R and qualitative methods. The idea is to get to that point by creating different data sets derived from commonly used legal sources that law students or graduates would be familiar with and incorporating them into a single platform with a few examples of practical use and application as well as code to encourage such persons to see the “why”. On this platform, I would like to share resources to places where the intro to R courses are available, etc. At this stage, this is an idea I have and I hope to develop it as the week's progress.

- description: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a revolutionary technique with wide applications in biology. Its applications are widely being used from young researchers to pioneer researchers of the field. The NGS data analysis has various approaches and many resources are explaining these methods. However, it can be difficult for beginners in this field to quickly understand and apply these methods. Also, beginner researchers might not have enough knowledge to overcome the most common errors that are encountered during these analyses. Due to the challenges that we mentioned above, in this project, we aimed to create a comprehensive open educational resource explaining NGS data analysis and its different methods and offer an example for the application of methodology and solutions to the most common errors. We believe that this project will be enlightening for anyone interested in NGS data analysis by providing a necessary roadmap.

The Institute is in the process of creating an open online learning platform to host training and learning materials, covering a range of subjects related to Data Science and AI. In order to ensure that the offering is useful to our audience, that it is responsive to their needs, and that it continues to grow, it is key to involve them in the creation and direction of the resources. Having real user voices and input will help to create an open learning space that is truly useful and valuable. Not only that, but the platform can serve as a central meeting point where learners can come together over shared interests and issues, and collaborate on projects that may have a wider impact.

In order to do this, learners will need a way to connect and communicate effectively."

The goal is to provide a platform - in the form of an open knowledge graph and associated interface - that will allow researchers (even those with minimal familiarity with the underlying technology) to explore linked representations of metadata for the included datasets and models. Researchers should be able to survey a variety of models that target phenomena at different scales; ranging from process-based models of the cellular determinants of wood formation, to empirical models of gross tree growth in different environmental contexts. The linked information should allow complex questions to be asked, including: how similar models differ; which datasets can be repurposed to test different model outputs; and identifying   whether and how different models can be composed together. This will promote open scientific practices in this research area (through the use of common metadata standards and terms), and may serve as a valuable framework for collaborative knowledge capture and exploration.'

- description: We propose SciHack, as the first Open Community Lab in Peru. Our principal aim is to make available the tools and resources necessary for anyone, including non-professionals, to conduct biological engineering research and learning. As part of our activities, we will focus on democratizing science and biotechnology knowledge in low-income populations of Peru where there's little to no presence of science and technology education. To address these issues, we will conduct workshops about DIY lab equipment, Bioinformatics open source projects and educational resources, and molecular biology tools to train teachers and teach students how to make and analyze scientific experiments. Furthermore, by the end of our activities, we would like to implement a space for bio-makers of all ages and backgrounds to conduct research projects and build prototypes. In this way, we would be fighting against misinformation of science methodology and results that are primordial not only for the current COVID19 situation but also for the progress of science.

- description: I would like to work with the Skills Team at the Alan Turing institute in order to create a peer-mentoring training programme from the main topics of The Turing Way. Our aim is to turn the five main areas in The Turing Way, namely research reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics into modules which the participants of the peer-mentoring programme can work on together. They would apply it on their own research/ projects, therefore they could put the learnt knowledge in use immediately. The aim of The Turing Way has been to be an open source, collaborative, applicable, and practical tool, and with this programme we would like to facilitate the use of it. We would like to see how people in their different stages of their career (PhD, Post-Doc, Researcher, Admin) can collaborate to deepen their knowledge about the contents of The Turing Way, while understand each other's perspective on the subject. If the prototype is successful, we would like open it up for any applicants interested in applying the practices of The Turing Way to their own projects as part of the other trainings offered by the Institute.

Homogeneous catalysts are important in many of our daily processes, but also in our fight against climate change. Our goal was to create a tool that can automatically generate large datasets that can be used in research for data-driven catalyst discovery.


The issue was that a simple SMILES representation of a molecular scaffold does not work when it contains a transition metal complex. With this tool we use the 3D coordinates of a molecular scaffold and let the user place molecular fragments to create many variations of this scaffold. Other inorganic chemistry fields that use transition-metal containing molecules might benefit from this tool as well. A first prototype is published, but several things can be done to increase the usability of our tool."

- description: We have created the [Ersilia Model Hub](https://github.com/ersilia-os/ersilia), a FLOSS platform containing AI/ML models for infectious and neglected disease research . These models can be accessed with little to no-coding expertise, solving a major roadblock in the applicability of such technologies to day-to-day research. The Hub currently includes a hundred open source models, both from the literature and developed by the [Ersilia organization](https://ersilia.io). With this project, we aim to open the Hub to the whole computer science community, encouraging third-author model depositions so that the code they develop is not simply open source but also deployed in a user-friendly manner. By leveraging the Hub architecture, computer scientists can reach more users, interact with them and further the impact of the assets they have developed by facilitating its implementation in real case scenarios. To this end, the project will focus on establishing clear guidelines on the quality of the software and its reproducibility (as it won't necessarily be yet peer-reviewed) and creating a standard model deposition form and minimum required documentation. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a community of contributors by facilitating their access.

- description: Living in South Africa, and in much of the world, you can see a large gap in the accessibility of healthcare resources based on a person's income and education level. I am privileged enough to have had access to good quality healthcare resources throughout my life, which resulted in me being seen by numerous different therapists, counsellors and psychologists and being diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, more specifically Asperger's syndrome. I am also privileged in that I am able to comfortably speak and read English.   Unfortunately, a large percentage of our country has a very poor level of education, often not being able to read or speak English very well. Most South African resources I have found for individuals with, and parents of children with, autism are only available in English. My project aims to create a database of resources in a variety of South African languages, both written and as a video format (due to poor literacy rates, especially among older generations due to historical discrimination), in easy to understand language and with concepts that are easy to grasp. This is also useful as more people will be able to access online resources than resources at a healthcare facility.

- description: As open science projects mature, they attract, engage and retain members who actively participate and contribute to the project. They build *Communities of Practice* around the project through knowledge exchange, maintenance or development practices and ultimately guide the future directions for both the projects and their communities. To build a more equitable, resilient and sustainable open infrastructure for a diverse community, it is important to select governance models that give voices to people (users, contributors and wider society) from different socio-technical and socio-cultural backgrounds, identities, career stages, contextual needs and   research communities.  The Turing Way is a guide for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research and data science. Open Life Science is a training and mentoring program to help researchers learn and apply open principles in their work. They are mission-aligned open science projects that involve participants from around the world to create something deeply meaningful for them. The Turing Way has grown exponentially in the last three years that offers more than 200 pages co-created by more than 300 contributors. Open Life Science has offered 4 cohorts in the last 2 years and currently supports a community of over 300 members (present and past mentees, mentors and experts).  To support the governance work in these projects in 2022, I would like to carry out a systematic study of governance models suitable for decentralised and distributed communities such as these. By creating a portfolio of governance models suitable for projects at different maturity levels, members from these projects will be able to identify the right model for their respective  projects. The aim is to establish norms, workflows and processes that ensure a  democratic structure for decision-making and leadership in a way that contributes to projects' own visions while collaborating on the shared mission for global open science.

This committee aims to increase the knowledge of and implementation of open science practices in phytolith research. We are embracing an open source approach to our work in this committee so that the work of our committee is transparent. This will include open documentation, regularly communicating with our community, and providing guidelines and communication channels to enable our community to engage with us. Therefore, we want to establish a solid base for this work going forward by further developing our GitHub repository - adding clear contributing guidelines and documentation on how the committee   is to be run. All members of the committee will also benefit from training in  all aspects of open science practices. This will allow us to gain further insight into the training and initiatives that we want to work on with our community.

We will also start to develop training packages specific to phytolith research such as in open publishing and open and FAIR data."

One of my ambitions is curating events and engage public to open discussions around open science. One of the events that I really want to arrange is through art (as a means) to raise awareness around open science practices, and create the floor for an open discussion around open science.  It is still a general idea, so I am aware that I still need to go over all the details and I am still not sure what blockages will rise through this journey. But I am really positive and I truly believe that art is open and can act as a mediator towards connection, expression, openness, and understanding.

The first phase of this study involved target validation, primer, and probe design using open-access tools. Here, a principal component analysis (PCA) of the R/adegenet package (Jombart et al, 2010) and phylogenetic tree (Neighbour-joining) using R/ape package (Paradis et al, 2004) to cluster repeats of the chosen amplification target. These clusters were aligned to generate a consensus sequence for designing primers and probes for establishing the LAMP assay. I have designed an incorporated strand displacement probe using the engineering guideline of Juan et al, 2015 and the open-access Nupack software tool. The assay has and the master mix is being lyophilized for further experimental evaluation.


The sensitivity of this kit will be evaluated on extracted DNA from three sample types: saliva, urine, and clinical blood, with crude samples, lysed using lysis buffer. Correlation generated from these results will inform the best sensitive amplification. Further, a possible decay of the lyophilised master mix will be evaluated for six months to ascertain possible shelf-life.'

The first Open Science MOOC started in 2018 and on average the course attracts about 1000 participants from an international environment.   As the course runs participants engage with the teachers and each other through discussion forums. Here they introduce themselves, post assignments, and share and reply to each other''s thoughts. While a few participants actively contribute and respond in  the fora, engagement is still quite limited. Moreover, there is not yet a  strategy in place to maintain the community after the course has finished.   We would like to strengthen the community building taking place during and after this course by implementing additional strategies to engage participants during the course run and keeping up with participants after the course has finished."

During the OLS program, we aim to build an open community around Hub23 to help to guide future technical developments, and encourage use and contributions from the wider Turing community. We will host a series of Zero-to-Binder workshops aimed at introducing Turing researchers to regular binder, followed by structured discussion of what the ideal features of a collaborative reproducible environment for research would be. Any conclusions and subsequent technical development will be fed upstream to Binderhub, and we also aim to open source the methodologies used to create an internal binderhub deployment, allowing other organisations to do so."

- description: "We aim to build an online platform and community that allows open sharing, storage, and synthesis of clinical (meta)data, crucial for the development of modern, transdiagnostic, FAIR neuropsychology. First, published peer-reviewed papers will be scrapped to collect already available (meta)data. Second, our platform will allow direct uploading of clinical brain maps and their corresponding metadata.


A basic automated preprocessing and data-quality check pipeline will be implemented. Key data will be automatically extracted, synthesized, and made available alongside the one directly uploaded. All the available demographic, behavioral, clinical, and cognitive data will be properly organized and mapped onto the neural data to allow statistical analysis (i.e., data-driven lesion-symptom mapping). Ultimately, probabilistic maps synthesizing transdiagnostic information on lesion-symptom mapping would be constantly updated as more data are gathered. To this end, data visualization will be critical (e.g. http://speechbrainviewer.com/). Overall, the platform will


1. enable sharing of FAIR neuropsychological datasets across research centres and groups;

2. foster understanding of the topographical distribution and morphological characteristics of brain lesions;

3. allow large-scale, data-driven exploration of the associations between behavior and cognitive symptoms and brain regions."

- description: 'Open science is vital for reproducible, fair, and rigorous research. For its principles to thrive, we need OS practices to be shared and adopted by as many scientists as possible, from the earliest stages of their career. A 2017 survey by the European Commission reports that, among 1277 researchers at all career stages, the majority were unaware of the OS concept, and had never attended an OS initiative (from the Open Science Skills Working Group Report, July 2017).


For open research to become an established reality, those who are moving their first steps into research must have the opportunity to develop the necessary skillset to apply and disseminate the OS framework. "Open Science, Open Future" aims to be an educational resource to be used online by young scientists: undergraduates, MSc students, and potentially high-school pupils. The curriculum will consist of several modules explaining why each aspect of the OS practice can improve research and make it fairer (e.g. best practices in sharing protocols, storing data, publishing, collaborating). I''m the co-founder of a pan-european collective of scientists, http://biotop.co/, aiming at rethinking the way we do science. Fellow members are willing to take part to the project.'

Cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent among the group of treatable diseases in African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 10% of histopathology needs are met and this is a major barrier to comprehensive management of cancers


1. There is a shortage of clinicians and pathologists available for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the critical factors in treatment efficiency is the correct and timely diagnosis of specimens by pathologists. However, there is currently a significant shortage of cancer care clinicians in Africa and an even more considerable shortage of pathologists. In Cameroon, there are 19 pathologists currently in practice for 22,179,707 inhabitants

2. The absolute number of patients with cancer in Cameroon was estimated to be 25,000 cases a year.


Diagnosis of cancer relies on histology in nearly 80% of cases, cytology in 10%, and clinical diagnosis in 10% (1). There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of   cancers, to increase cancer treatment efficacy and reduce overtreatment of tumors clinically suspicious for malignancy.   We propose a hybrid diagnosis method with a deep Learning algorithm applied on hematoxylin and eosin histology slides. Digital microscopy and telepathology were already successfully used to mitigate the lack of pathologists in Cameroon, thus confirming the availability of a robust dataset for our project (1). Following splitting into training, validation and test sets, we will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm before deployment and tests. In addition to automated diagnostic, the developed program will have specific features such as sample information storage and tracking software as well as image optimization and analysis tools.

ARPHAI pilots data-driven open source tools using artificial intelligence and data science towards upgrading Argentina's electronic health record (EHR) system. ARPHAI is part of the [Global South AI4COVID Program](https://covidsouth.ai/).


ARPHAI includes persons from 20  institutions. ARPHAI started in October 2020 and has grown very fast from scratch. More specifically, ARPHAI is piloting three EHR-based components in parallel to anticipate and detect potential epidemic outbreaks

1. The extraction of computable phenotypes of diseases, symptoms, and syndromes using natural language processing to analyze EHR structured and free-text;

2. Models for understanding and prediction of relevant epidemiological variables using computable phenotypes and open data information as input; and

3. Dashboard visualization of the results from both points above, along with additional open data sources to inform decisions made by the public sector epidemiological authorities.


There are two additional lines of work ARPHAI undertakes that are transversal to these three research developments, which include a) diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) with a focus on gender and b) responsible use of health data."

- description: The project focuses on building tools to understand the evolution of life. We develop bioinformatic tools to determine evolutionary processes to detect early stage life development. The project looks at data from two specific parts of detecting life - co-evolution of life and environment and biosignature assessment within the context of habitability. We use data from current experimental projects and develop new models to aid the growth of astrobiology search for life. The platform will cater to multiple sections such as- data management from all astrobiology projects, experiments, research labs and conferences; new tools to analyse data, predictive model section to simulations from the data set and collaborative forum to encourage citizen science.The platform will help create open source bioinformatic tools to help detect biosignature, assess habitability, promote involvement within  astrobiology. In addition to using bioinformatic tools, a part of the platform will use game theory and gamification to test the citizen science component. Using both the platform as a destination for tool testing and science education, we hope to advance the research in astrobiology.

1. Scientific perspectives Depression is becoming more common mental illness caused by the complicate network of various extrinsic and intrinsic stimulators.For the healthier and happier brain status, three key diets such as Emotional,Physical, and Nutritional diets should be considered. Scientific researchers are mostly focusing on research in unraveling the key molecule associated the mechanism of depression. However, we need to pull and process more extensive dataset from individuals, public health, and professionals in psychology, nutrition science, physical science, and neuroscience to improve or treat the brain kept or recovered to the healthy status.

2. Open science perspectives.   For comprehensive data, we need to build up the collaborative digital network with trust through benefiting to each participant to accelerate innovation from the open dataset. Effective collaboration tool or co-creation platform for the intersectoral collaboration would be required for the practice in this project."
