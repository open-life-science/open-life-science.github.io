  description: |
    Reproducibility in life science always been in debate.
    Althogly lately standard practices have adopted in different aspects,
    sometimes these might not practically applicable by the end researcher.
    Reproducibility practices need to be used by all, then only it will be
    successful in both ends (research producer and research reader).
    To bridge this gap, a lot of practical training is required.
    This is where this project comes in picture.
    Here we aim of creating training materials for doing
    reproducible research in a more practical and application-oriented way
    with a specific focus on niche areas of respective research
    (for now bioinformatics as a starting point).
    Not only limited to materials, as well as virtual training
    by promoting the practuce of creating and sharing of Computational
    Environment and Analysis in a reproducible manner with systems in scaling.

  description: |
    I want to work out a way to use data visualization to map the current state
    of scientific knowledge within the life sciences.
    Some literature on mapping science already exists, but most was written before
    the machine learning revolution. The more contemporary literature suffers
    from other mistakes, such as flawed comparisons of studies (using the same
    terminology in different manners) and, most importantly, not all scientific
    research is easily available. Thus, Open Science should be an integral
    component of any effort to map scientific knowledge. In this project, I
    aim to outline which Open Science practices currently exist that facilitate
    the mapping of science, which Open Science practices are needed to facilitate
    the mapping of science and how a prototype for a collaborative effort to map
    science could look like.

- name: Creating community awareness of open science practices in phytolith research
  participants:
    - ekaroune
  mentors:
    - yvanlebras
  description: |
    I have been conducting my own research to assess the state of data sharing
    in phytolith analysis. The results show that data sharing practices are
    minimal (articles are currently being written!). Therefore, I am aware that
    my discipline needs to focus on open science practices to develop more
    transparent and robust methodologies. I want to raise awareness of the need
    for open science practices, initially focusing on data sharing. This will
    involve distributing my current research findings widely through blogs and
    conference talks, and these efforts will enable the formation of community
    connections to initiate a working group for open science in my field.
    There are currently working groups for nomenclature and morphometrics in
    phytolith analysis as part of the International Phytolith Society. Initial
    efforts of the working group would be to investigate the best ways to share
    data, developing resources/training opportunities for students and early
    career researchers, and recommending/publishing guidelines for colleagues
    to follow.

- name: Synthetic Biology Chassis Toolkit for Public Domain Use
  participants:
    - smklusza
  mentors:
    - anita-broellochs
  description: |
    A synthetic biology platform that is compatible with existing and future
    public-domain biotechnologies in the Biosafety-Level -1 (BSL-1) organism
    Bacillus subtilis. Bacillus subtilis has the ability to secrete biomaterials
    outside of the cell and also undergoes sporulation under certain conditions,
    which provides a stable way of storing DNA at room temperature without a
    need for refrigeration.
    Despite the tremendous progress in synthetic biology and biomanufacturing
    industries, most innovations are patented with various restrictions on
    use and impedes global access and use of these tools. A synthetic biology
    toolkit that exclusively uses technologies in the public domain is the first
    step towards providing scientists and non-scientists the tools to conduct
    science and create valuable biomaterials for their communities without restriction.

- name: Creating a single pipeline for metagenome classification
  participants:
    - muhammetcelik
  mentors:
    - malloryfreeberg
  description: |
    Metagenomics has been increasingly becoming very important in studies of
    human and animal health. It has become clear that bacteria in and on our
    bodies are very significant. Thus there is a big boost in science society
    who are willing to study metagenomics. When we want to do downstream analysis
    in our microbial community, the first step is to find out about our community,
    what the community ultimately looks like. My idea is that benchmark the state
    of the art tools (such as Kraken2, Centrifuge and CLARK) and create a single
    pipeline that will produce a single pdf file with cutoff-significance-sensitivity
    values for each tool. Later we can set that pipeline on web-based system that
    would make the researchers easier for the scientists.

    The project currently consists of a WordPress site (unlaunched), a Dropbox
    for material storage, and a Twitter account for dissemination. I own the
    copyright for all of the materials, and they are free to use for academic
    purposes, such as lecture slides or handouts. The materials are made up of
    a mixture of graphical abstracts, tutorials, and reference pdfs; I hope to
    incorporate more formats, such as videos, as well.

    Open Innovation in Life Sciences is an open science organization that
    promotes the practice of open science in the Zurich-area life science
    research community. We are a bottom-up approach focusing on early career
    researchers (ECRs) that complements the Swiss national and institutional
    top-down open science initiatives. We are currently establishing an official
    Swiss association in collaboration with Life Science Zurich and expanding
    our program to include open science workshops/courses for ECRs and public
    lectures to complement our annual conference and keep the discussion on
    open science active all year round. The association will be operated by
    ECRs working with a board of academic and industry leaders thus it doubles
    as a career training program adding hands-on experience of practicing soft
    skills (e.g. teamwork, communication, etc.) and learning non-scientific
    expertise (e.g. project management, budgeting, advertising, etc.) to
    enhance traditional Ph.D. and Postdoctoral training.

  mentors:
    - luispedro

  description: |
    Open Science practices have the potential to benefit everyone in the life
    science community (and broader society), but their adoption is limited by
    incentive structures that reward ‘fast’ and unreliable science at the
    individual level. ‘Crowd-acting’ platforms (e.g., Kickstarter, Collaction)
    can overcome such collective action problems by organising ‘pledges’ for a
    particular behaviour, which are only acted on if and when a predetermined
    critical mass of support is met. By protecting individuals’ interests until
    such time that they have the support of their community, crowd-acting
    platforms can thus resolve the collective action problem and increase the
    uptake of the beneficial behaviour in question. Similarly, Project Free Our
    Knowledge aims to organise collective action in the global research
    community. Researchers can create and sign campaigns asking their peers to
    adopt a new behaviour, but only act on that pledge if a certain threshold
    of support is met (e.g., 1000 signatures). If and when the threshold is
    reached, everyone who has signed that campaign will be listed on the website
    and directed to carry out the new behaviour in unison, with the protection
    of their peers.

    project providing tools, workflows, computational resources and training
    materials in many different scientific areas. At the beginning of
    September 2020, I’ll be starting a new position at the University
    of Freiburg to help with the community management within the European
    Galaxy team. European Galaxy community has grown both in number and
    fields, standing in need of coordination across several countries that
    need to work collaboratively to achieve common goals. My new role will
    include the responsibility of coordinating the European Galaxy and
    scientific community as well as strengthening the relationship with the
    Australian community, helping build the Asian and African communities,
    and event organisation around Bioconda, BioContainers and Galaxy. With
    this personal project, I would like to advance my community building and
    project management skill while enhancing the connection with the

#    MolPDF does one thing right now and is convert a list of 1D SMILES
#    representation of a chemical to a 2D image and into a PDF. For example
#    if a user would like to pass in a list of 100,000 molecules MolPDF will
#    render the PDF with their 1D and 2D images in a table in PDF. The
#    MolPDFParser() can read in a MolPDF file and then pass it back as a
#    variable list.
#    Since there is no open source project IUPAC naming schema for molecules,
#    I've designed a language AI to convert between SMILES and IUPAC.
#    There is plenty of rooms for improvement and inviting support from others.
#    Furthermore, pdf format might not be the most accessible file format when
#    working with open and reproducible software and workflows. Therefore, with
#    my participation in this program, I would like to learn from my mentors
#    about how to implement open science principles in my research.

- name: Global land-use and land-cover data under historical, current, and future climatic conditions for ecologists
  participants:

    - yvanlebras
  description: |
    Land-Use Land-cover (LULC) data are important predictors of species
    occurrence and biodiversity threats. Although there are LULC datasets
    available for ecologists under current conditions, there is a lack of
    such data under past and future climatic conditions. This hinders
    projecting the predictions from niche and distribution models over
    global change scenarios at different time periods. The Land Use
    Harmonization Project ([LUH2](https://luh.umd.edu/data.shtml)) is a global
    dataset in raster format covering continental areas, and provides massive
    LULC data from 850 to 2300. However, these data are compressed in a file
    format (NetCDF) that are intractable by most ecologists. We aim to selected
    the most useful LULC data for ecologists, transformed the existing dataset
    into regular GIS formats and derived new LULC data often used in
    macroecology and ecological niche modeling and provide this data LULC data
    for thirty-seven time slices from year 900 to 2100, with the following
    temporal resolution - every 100 years from 900 to 1950, every 10 years from
    1950 to 2010, and every five years from 2010 to 2300.

    BioLab Open Source Projects is the beginning of a platform where biomedical
    researchers, and computer scientists will work closely with to solve some
    main tropical infectious diseases through collaboration and sharing ideas.
    Being the main source of problems in Africa, tropical diseases are
    affecting the socio-economic development of this part of the world. The
    time is now the raise the state of the consciousness of the problem by
    creating an environment where the only interest is sharing. Sharing ideas,
    knowledge, skills, and opportunities about biology. The main challenge in
    African biomedical research science is the lack of resources and sharing
    skills, especially amount young generation of the scientist whom most of
    the time doesn’t have the orientation and necessary information to address.
    The project stands to build a community around the main challenge surrounding
    tropical infectious diseases as Malaria, Tuberculosis… To tackle this challenge
    of the biological understanding of the proportion of burden, the need for more
    training prospective and collaboration between students, young researchers,
    and potential supervising programs. We will try to build an open-source
    project around these challenges to better understand these diseases'
    interaction modes with drugs via bioinformatics tools. The benefit will
    provide training support to the students, young researchers together and
    bring solutions for general health problems, and be able to share them on
    collaboration purposes and training.

    This is a brand new project for the target approach in the stages of liver
    cirrhosis. This project will identify the significant reasons behind
    developing cirrhosis and to prevent that staging development in continuation
    of this damage. The major focuses to reverse the damage into healthy
    condition are the enzymes, mutations, snp, genetic factors related to
    disease progression. These are the key aspects to target the stages of
    liver cirrhosis and to identify there role to a healthy growing liver or
    decrease there damaging features.

- name: Science For All (Sci4All) - Citizens' daily problem solving by engaging multidisciplinary scientific communities
  participants:

  mentors:
    - klauer2207
  description: |
    The project concept is to establish a collaboration between the general
    public and scientists, where the citizens can expose their daily issues and
    scientists can collaborate to try to find solutions for them. For that purpose,
    we aim to establish a multidisciplinary scientific network who help citizens
    to improve their daily life.
    To start the project, we think it is more appropriate to first create
    local communities, starting in Madrid as it the location of the applicants.
    In the future, the local network can be expanded or occasionally contact
    other local communities, such as the ones already established by means of
    this program (Barcelona, Utrecht, Montreal), to work collaboratively in
    global public issues. Connections with companies can also be established
    (for example, to help in the production of prototypes) but with the
    requirement of use open licenses and follow the precepts of this program.

    Using UMAP and network propagation to make a fast, accurate and
    interpretable supervised learning algorithm. We will benchmark our
    novel method against other state-of-the art machine learning algorithms
    using image analysis data, and other single-cell readouts.
    Supervised tasks using features with many artifacts and strange
    distributions and are typically solved using computationally intensive
    neural nets. This kind of data frequently occurs in morphological image
    analysis and bioinformatics generally.
    We would like to apply the technique to different datasets, investigate
    its theoretical underpinnings and see whether GPUs and other computational
    resources can be leveraged to improve the speed of classifications.
    Publish the results in an open science journal and make the code available
    to the community.

  description: |
    This project aims to develop a database of open-access Immunology
    pre-prints and publications on COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds,
    scientists are working round-the-clock to generate data, resulting in an
    upsurge of information on various aspects of the virus. Various publishers
    such as Lancet, Elsevier, Oxford, New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
    Nature, have open access early journal releases and publications on a wide
    range of fields covering the COVID-19 topic. Many efforts are still underway
    to develop a feasible vaccine with trials taking place at different research
    centers globally. An open repository of open access pre-prints and journal
    articles in the area of COVID-19 immunology and vaccinology will easily
    connect researchers on current data available for efficient communication
    of scientific research and open science principles. The repository will be
    divided into subsections of publications from the 7 continents to be able
    to easily identify how the disease is affecting different geographical
    locations.

  mentors:

  description: |
    We recently received some funding from our university to host a workshop
    about 3D modeling methods for biomechanics. This sparked the idea of creating
    some sort of online database of workflows in our field. This website will
    serve early career researchers or researchers starting out with biomechanical
    analyses, or those wishing to switch their workflows (for example to be more
    freeware based). Currently there is a need for a central repository of such
    workflows. Usually they are only circulated within lab groups or between
    collaborators. However, an online hub with modeling resources would
    significantly reduce the time researchers need to invest in choosing
    programs and figuring out how to set up their models, giving them more
    time to do research and develop new methods. For this project, we
    specifically want to build a website with open source workflows, tips and
    tricks for setting up models for finite element analysis, as well as other
    3D workflows (such as fossil reconstruction in freeware programs).

- name: Open Science Office Hours to support trainees in Montreal to help make their research more open and reproducible
  participants:
    - koudyk
  mentors:
    - ajstewartlang
  description: |
    The goal of this project is to establish Open-Science Office Hours, a
    meeting space where students in Montreal can come throughout the year
    to get help making their research more open and reproducible. This
    initiative will promote Open Education in life science, particularly in
    the area of neuroimaging data science. Students in this field often learn
    hard skills in open science at weekend workshops, summer schools, and
    hackathons, but there is a gap in the learning experience regarding
    long-term support. The main measurable outcome of this project would be
    having a group of senior trainees who take turns hosting Open-Science
    office hours at regular intervals throughout the year. These meetings
    would take place virtually and/or in person in Montreal, Canada (depending
    on COVID-19).
    Although we hope to spark this initiative, it would need community support
    to be sustainable. In the first stage, I would welcome collaborators to
    help plan. Later, we would need support in the form of funding so that we
    can compensate TA’s; this would help enable less-privileged trainees to get
    involved as TA's. Finally, we would need to recruit the TA's. Thus, this
    project will involve community contributions at all stages, in various capacities.

- name: Registered Reports in Primate Neurophysiology
  participants:
    - da5nsy
  mentors:
    - ivotron
  description: |
    In this new project I aim to explore the specific challenges (both
    practical and metascience related) to adoption of registered reports in
    primate neurophysiology. As far as we aware there has not yet been a
    registered report within the field of non-human-primate (NHP)
    neurophysiology. There are specific challenges for using this format
    within this field; some practical and some metascientific. A central issue
    is that the existing format for registered reports focuses on hypothesis
    testing, whereas neurophysiology is quite often an exploratory and
    iterative process. Working with NHPs is a necessarily limited privilege
    and comes with considerable responsibility; the cost of having experiments
    where the results are not robust, or where opportunities for discovery
    are missed, is particularly high, since opportunity for replication is
    limited. Therefore, peer review in advance of performing an experiment
    seems a particularly valuable idea. This project would explore ways in
    which to find compromise in the conflict between existing registered
    report formats and current methodologies in primate neurophysiology.

    We are building Open Science UMontreal (OSUM) - a student initiative -
    whose aims are to create an onboarding experience to the practice of
    open science (in all of its forms) for the predominantly french-speaking
    scientific community in Quebec (and beyond). We aim to attract as many
    stakeholders as possible (from scientists at the level of undergraduate,
    all the way to emeritus status); to unite those who already have a strong
    open science mindset and to build our resources such that we become the
    first point of contact for the local scientific community. OSUM will
    discuss open science values, principles, and practices. By raising awareness
    of current issues, we hope this project will continue to drive the culture
    shift and help people realize how they can immediately benefit from using
    open and reproducible practices. Furthermore, we strive to navigate our
    institution towards becoming an institutional member of OSF, just as the
    University of British-Columbia has done in the last year. As open science
    is a broad and wide-ranging concept with domain-specific definitions,
    we want to provide opportunities to meet and encourage the exchange of
    ideas within and across fields because we can all learn from each other.

  description: |
    There are many universities in Kenya in different counties offering
    life sciences as part of their curriculum. There’s, however, a difference
    in accessibility to resources. There are a number of science clubs in
    these universities. In light of the recent pandemic, there has been a
    change in how conferences and science events are being conducted, which
    has proven that online training is an effective mode of training and so is
    remote distribution of resources. With increasing need to adopt online
    trainings and conferences, and to narrow the gap in distribution of
    resources to different institutions and also encourage collaboration,
    I propose a platform that contains data of all science clubs in Kenyan
    institutions. The platform will allow submissions of training needs from
    the different institutions to allow narrowed down preparation and it will
    also allow collaboration of students from various institutions. From
    requests obtained, organization of talks and trainings can be more
    efficient and organized. These can transition into physical meetups eventually

  description: |
    The Bioinformatics community is one of the ever-growing communities in India,
    which has its presence across the length and breadth of the country. Likewise,
    the education and research programs spread across different branches of the
    Bioinformatics topic as its focus. There is a need for establishing open
    platform(s) where students, (early-career and established) researchers, policy
    makers could exchange knowledge freely across these different areas through
    open science practices and principles. In realizing such a platform, the
    benefits of following open principles need to be widely communicated for
    bringing awareness among the community by building pathways and encouraging
    contributors & ambassadors. The aim of this project is to explore the scope
    and path towards establishing an open platform and provide opportunities to
    participate, contribute and organize open initiatives.

- name: OpenWorkstation - A modular and open-source concept for customized automation equipment
  participants:
    - sebastianeggert
  mentors:
    - meagdoh
  description: |
    The OpenWorkstation project presents a modular and open-source concept to
    develop customized automation equipment. Inspired by assembly lines, the
    concept consists of ready-to-use and customizable hardware modules which
    can be plugged into the base frame. In contrast to current commercial and
    open-source standalone solutions, this concept enables the combination of
    single hardware modules – each with a specific set of functionalities – to
    a modular workstation to provide a fully automated setup.
    The base setup consists of a pipetting and transport module and is designed
    to execute basic protocol steps for in vitro research applications,
    including pipetting operations for non-viscous and viscous liquids and
    transportation of cell culture vessels between the modules.
    The successful application of this concept is presented within a case study
    by the development of a storage module to facilitate high-throughput studies
    and a crosslinker module to initiate polymerization of hydrogel solutions.
    By combining capabilities from various open source instrumentations into a
    modular technology platform, this concept has the potential to facilitate
    the development of customized automation equipment for efficient and
    reliable experimentation for in vitro research. Ultimately, the
    OpenWorkstation concept will allow empower academic groups to the develop
    their own equipment to automated their research workflows.

    The Turing Way project aims to provide all the information that data
    scientists in academia, industry, government and in the third sector need
    at the start of their projects to ensure that they are easy to reproduce
    and reuse at the end. The Guide for Ethical Research is one book of the
    project (complementing the other four which cover reproducible research,
    project design, communication, and collaboration).
    Producing an initial a full draft of the Guide for Ethical Research aims to
    positively impact research in the following ways:

    1. Equipping data science researchers to approach their work in a more reflective way and to
    think holistically about their research, its processes and outcomes
    2. Equipping scientists working in a range of fields to advocate for ethical
    research at all stages of the research process.
    3. Compiling diverse research ethics resources in one area.

    sktime is a new Python toolbox for machine learning with time series.
    We provide state-of-the-art time series algorithms and scikit-learn
    compatible tools for building, optimising and evaluating complex models,
    based on a clear taxonomy of learning tasks and clear design principles and
    patterns. We want to enable understandable and accessible machine learning
    with time series by providing instructive documentation and by building a
    friendly, collaborative and inclusive community. The aim is to unify the
    time series analysis field by providing a common framework for multiple
    learning tasks, bringing together contributors from academia and the wider
    data science community into a joint framework and embedding best practices
    into the time series analysis field.

    Our goal at Turing Data Stories is to produce educational data science
    content through the storytelling medium for the general public. Our
    content will be split into different stories, which begin with an
    interesting and relevant real-world hypothesis and walks the user through
    the entire data science process - from gathering and cleaning the data,
    to using it for data analysis. The aim of the Turing Data Stories is to
    spark curiosity and motivate more people to play with data.
    The Turing Data Stories are detailed and pedagogic Jupyter Notebooks that
    document an interesting insight or result using real world open data.
    A Turing Data Story follows these principles:
    1. The story should be told in an engaging and educational way, describing
    both the context of the story and the methods used in the analysis.
    2. The analysis must be fully reproducible (the notebooks should be
    executable by others using a provided computer environment, requiring no
    installation of software)
    3. The results should be transparent, all data sources are correctly referred to
    or included.
    4. In order to maintain the quality of the results, the story
    should be peer-reviewed by other contributors before being published.

    The Turing Way book is a community-driven book for reproducible research
    in data science. It is written by data scientists, academics, researchers,
    students, technologists, software engineers, policymakers, educators and
    other stakeholders from varying technical backgrounds.
    I will be contributing to the project as a technical writer from
    September 2020 to December 2020 where I will have the following
    responsibilities:
    1. Helping authors in effectively engaging with the
    project and collaborating in groups to write, edit and review current and
    new chapters in the book.
    2. Developing resources that will ensure
    consistency across all chapters and make the book more comprehensible for
    readers.
    3. Making pages more responsive and discoverable so that readers
    can read it on any device (like a smartphone or a tablet) with the same
    efficiency.
    4. Participating in the community discussions of the project
    to learn about the experience of its readers, authors, collaborators, and
    other members through their stories of using the book.

    All these tasks in The Turing Way will require me to integrate Open
    Science principles and community practices, which I am confident to learn
    with my participation in the Open Life Science training and mentoring program.

    The Design for Retrofit project I work on at The Alan Turing Institute,
    within the Data-Centric Engineering programme aims to use data-driven methods
    to address uncertainty in design stage decision-making towards reducing the
    carbon impact of homes through retrofit. This involves quantification of the
    current energy demand of housing archetypes and physics-based modelling to
    evaluate the impact of energy-efficiency technologies available to be installed
    in the home during the retrofit process. However, uncertainty exists due to a
    lack of monitored data on indoor air temperature, which leads to a performance
    gap between modelled and monitored energy demand as heating practices are the
    most sensitive parameter within building energy modelling. Further uncertainty
    is acknowledged due to a lack of longitudinal data following retrofit. Such
    data could inform the evaluation of long-term impacts of technologies installed,
    to inform future decision making. Motivated householders who are planning or
    recently completed a retrofit project might be interested to share data, perhaps
    in return for research insight on the impacts and success of similar projects
    through a citizen science approach. This is an idea in development for follow-on
    research which requires data collection protocols, ethical guidelines and data
    repositories.

    This project is to build an online citizen science platform with the
    collaboration of autistic people and their families. The platform will
    then be used to gather experiences in order to investigate how sensory
    processing might affect the ways autistic people navigate the world
    around them. We are also using learning from the project to create a
    framework to support researchers in making their own work more participatory.
    The project is a collaboration between The Alan Turing Institute – the
    UK's national institute for data science and AI research, and Autistica,
    a UK autism research charity. I am working under the supervision of
    Dr. Kirstie Whitaker, an academic who is committed to the principles of
    open research and building welcoming and inclusive online communities.
    The funding for the project is a result of a James Lind priority setting
    alliance run by Autistica. It is a complex project with multiple
    stakeholders. Open Humans, a foundation who have provided the back end
    for the platform, and a development team from Fujitsu are currently
    co-designing the front-end interface with the input of the autistic
    community. Most important are a diverse and growing number of autistic
    participants and (sometimes overlapping) open source developers.
