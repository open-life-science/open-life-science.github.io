- description: This project aims to create a template for an engaging Open Science
    course tailored to the needs and abilities of high school students. It will use
    a catchy premise of learning Data Science to introduce students to good (open)
    scientific practices and explain the importance of such practices. The teaching
    materials will be composed of several modules, each including short presentation
    on key topics, reading, quizzes, and hands-on activities, and a mini-project.
    For the latter, we will apply Data Science techniques to investigate science itself,
    specifically a corpus of scientific literature (Big Data, accessed via free Dimensions
    accounts). Students will plan and conduct meta-science projects on chosen topics.
    In other exercises, students will track the life cycle of a scientific publication
    and get into the shoes of one of the researchers. We will explore some of the
    fundamental issues that modern science and scientists face, including incentives,
    fraud, questionable research practices and biases, and how science intersects
    with the broader society and policy. Overall, this course will deepen students
    understanding of science as a collective activity and a complex system with many
    players - helping young people to navigate their career in research and develop
    critical skills for other career paths.

    with less than 5% of them under any form of regulatory control of the Nigerian
    Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA).There is, therefore, a need for proper Quality
    Assurance QA testing during installation and control tests at regular intervals
    as this will further help to reduce repeated radiograph and rejected films thereby
    saving cost and reducing patient doses. This project is aimed at deterring the
    level of compliance of QA across radiology centres in Kano State and to also move
    ahead to develop a robust, multi-adaptor quality control kit for all forms of
    x-ray equipment. This will help to develop local capacity, improve healthcare
    and promote wellbeing for all ages of Nigerians in-line with Sustainable Development

    from 2024. I believe new systems and easier ways of accessing information with
    more vocal communities are needed to usher in the new generation. But to do so,
    the new bachelor and high school students must be the recipient of effective scientific
    communication to help them realize the existing communities and opportunities
    in life science research in India. As a penultimate bioengineering student, my
    exposure to existing communities is recent and new. This fact allows me to understand
    and appreciate the importance of such communities in guiding students with a passion
    for research in life sciences.  Life Science in 2022 India is a concept that seeks
    to unite parallel enterprises by individuals across the nation under one banner.  The
    goal is to provide a complete and interconnected picture of Life Science research
    and communities in India. Simultaneously, as a founder of a Bioengineering Chapter
    in my institution, I will be applying our findings to build and train my colleagues
    and juniors to have the tools and awareness to choose their next steps in research.  Finally,
    we measure the success of this project through the successful publication of a
    paper that encompasses the findings and suggestions for building a better and
    more robust open community of life science research in India.

- description: Mental health among researchers is a huge neglected burden that has
    significant impact on their lives and the people around them. Majority of the
    focus on mental health is in capacity building for mental health research or offering
    sustainable mental healthcare. The lack of conversations around how students undertaking
    research fail to complete projects or progress beyond certain levels in research
    shines a bright light on the intensity of neglect on the mental health of researchers.  It
    is therefore paramount to create awareness and avail tools catered to researchers
    needs. The project focus is to develop an open online support resource for primary
    mental health catered to researchers particularly scientific researchers. This
    platform will contain educational materials concerning emotional health which
    sits at the core of mental health. It will also contain self-assessment tools
    and techniques for developing mental resilience. In addition to that, the resource
    will contain a peer support network that will offer help and emotional support.
    The overall objective is to avail help, progress monitoring and increased understanding
    of the importance of mental health wellbeing among researchers.

    to grow our work up to date in a way that can catalyse changes in researchers'
    perceptions of open science across Ireland and later internationally. The first

    researchers (ECRs) for ECRs and other academics. The content of the MOOC is currently
    under review and is planned to launch in the late summer. We hope to grow the
    learning experience further by hosting workshops and events where individuals
    can learn from experts and share their own experiences about open science practices.

    private, written exclusively by me. There is a lot of work that needs to be done
    to prepare it for open sourcing -   I see it as fitting into a few different categories:
    * *Technical*: Commenting throughout the code, cleaning the code up, clarifying
    folder/file structure, rewriting confusing functions/variables, ensuring basic
    security * *Collaboration*: Documentation, contributing guidelines, code of conduct,

    more open, improves the quality, accessibility, and efficiency of science and
    education, Open Science Community Nigeria (OSCN) was established to provide a
    space that will encourage and promote openness, transparency and reproducibility
    in science among scientists, network of researchers and societal stakeholders
    in Nigeria. There are quite a number of some initiatives in Nigeria such as AI
    Hub, Nigeria, Python Nigeria and R User groups that mainly promote data science
    and computational sciences. However, none there exist a single community that
    instilled responsible conduct of research, promote the principles of open science
    and or establish a guiding principles and core values or policies that support
    scientists, researchers, and societal stakeholders to meet, inspire and co-create
    important things together as a community. Thus, we aim to establish and develop
    an open science community in Nigeria where newcomers and experienced peers interact,
    inspire each other to adopt Open Science practices and values, identify opportunities
    and pitfalls, and provide feedback on policies, infrastructure, and support services
    as does in other regions of the World. We aim to specifically target scientists,
    researchers and students who are passionate about open science but have little
    to no experience with open science principles and practices.

    develop an ontology that can assist Research Software Engineers (RSE's) to better
    manage their teams and affiliates. It also aims to enable better collaboration
    within the RSE community and between research institutions.    This project is
    driven by the growing need for RSE's by researchers, as research is becoming increasingly
    reliant on data-driven technologies, and within the academic community itself,
    there is an emphasis on providing reusable, reproducible data which is not a skill
    that most researchers have. By creating a semantic overview of the interaction
    between skills, technologies and the key role-players in the RSE community, this
    ontology will be able to provide information on the research fields that each
    RSE has background knowledge in, their development skills, and the services that
    they are willing to provide clients, enabling a way in which suitable RSEs can
    be assigned to projects where they will be able to provide software development
    and software-development-related assistance. This project also aligns with the
    thinking supported by Open Science, as the ontology is aimed to be reusable and
    reproducible.

    and many more. Furthermore, the project will identify open communities of practice
    related to research software and systems engineering, such as RLadies, Python
    User Groups, and HPC User Groups that could potentially supplement the support
    RSSE-Africa is providing.  For communities of practice, we will collect information
    on several attributes, including their focus area, communication platforms, activities
    offered, and more. This information will be shared in a Google Spreadsheet on
    the RSSE-Africa website and will be open for the community to contribute to and
    update as necessary. The RSSE-Africa website will simultaneously be updated to
    improve content and navigation.  The project will build on work done by members
    of the RSSE-Africa community and the Research Software Alliance (ReSA).

    and empowering community members to champion open and collaborative research practices.   We
    propose to do this through hosting workshops and events centred around collaborative

    open science and reproducibility and supplement with workshops on tools that support
    openness, collaboration, and reproducibility.   We aim to host regular "Collaborations

    systems and analytical tools that are currently running and under development
    in our group, as well as to contribute to the expanding global community of open
    science.    The proposed platform will provide adequate information for researchers
    in need of reproducible SRM. It can benefit cell biologists who are interested
    in advancing their research with the assistance of super-resolution imaging techniques,
    such as *single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)* and *super-resolution
    optical fluctuation microscopy (SOFI)* that our team focuses on, but lack the

- description: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death around the world
    and account for nearly 32% (2019) of all global deaths. The advancement in omics
    technologies over the recent years has provided a deeper understanding of the
    molecular processes and dynamic interactions involved in diseases which have helped

    targets. In my project, I aim to build a tool to carry out multi-omics analysis
    and profiling encompassing major CVD diseases using data from relevant datasets.
    The biological interests of this tool would be the identification of differentially
    expressed genes, proteins, metabolites, and transcripts, progression-associated
    genes, SNPs, pathways and networks involved, survival analysis, and small molecule
    identification. It would also include a user-friendly repository of data from
