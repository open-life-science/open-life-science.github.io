- name: PyOrb 1.0 – Automated Analysis Tool for Orbital Interactions
  description: 'Introducing PyOrb 1.0, a user-friendly, open-source software designed
    to streamline the analysis of orbital interactions within various fragments (e.g.,
    atoms in a chemical bond or reactants in a chemical reaction). By harnessing density
    functional theory computations, this program automates the exploration of Kohn-Sham
    molecular orbitals (KS-MOs), offering invaluable insights into the fundamental
    driving forces behind the chemical bond formation and reactions. Our primary objective
    is to develop an intuitive tool that effortlessly generates and consolidates essential
    details, including orbital overlaps, energy gaps, orbital Gross Mulliken populations,
    and coefficients of fragment orbitals within the broader molecular orbitals. The
    PyOrb 1.0 program will address three major challenges associated with the analysis
    of MO bonding mechanisms: 1. It automatically identifies the dominant orbital
    interaction patterns. 2. It presents three different orbital interaction schemes
    corresponding to different stages of bond formation. 3. It constructs the orbital
    diagram including a final plot summarizing the key molecular orbitals. While we
    have already created an initial prototype, there are several enhancements required
    to enhance the usability of our tool. PyOrb 1.0 holds immense potential in simplifying
    the systematic analysis of atomic and molecular bonding mechanisms, allowing users
    to concentrate on advanced analysis tasks. We plan to make the PyOrb 1.0 source
    code openly accessible online, accompanied by an introductory tutorial, to facilitate
    easy retrieval and utilization.'

  description: Inspired by Neuromatch and the many other open educational projects,
    we will produce high quality notebooks to intuitively teach scientific rigor.
    These notebooks will combine videos, interactives, text and equations into engaging
    teaching materials. Results will be jupyter notebooks, jupyter books, and good
    old fashioned webpages. Community for rigor will build an education team, a tech
    team, and a community team. All materials will be shared CC-BY. We hope to collaborate
    with a wider open community in optimizing the materials for a broad range of scientists.
    If we can lower the incidence of non-rigorous science even just by a few percentage
    points we would majorly improve biomedical research.

  description: In order to mitigate climate change and ensure global food security,
    agriculture is essential. Traditional farming methods however causes environmental
    harm and increase greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture has a tremendous amount
    of potential to be transformed into a sustainable and climate-resilient industry
    as a result of digitalization and cutting-edge technologies. This proposal describes
    a method for promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing climate change by
    using digitalization.

- name: 'Wind Power System Stability Analysis for Grid Integration: A Statistical
    Mechanics Approach to the Swing Equation.'
  description: Stabilizing wind power output for grid integration is a challenge due
    to variable-speed turbines, causing fluctuating power generation. To prevent voltage
    overloading, the grid power system must undergo rapid changes to maintain stability.
    The Swing equation is widely used for stability analysis, but its classical model
    may lead to erroneous conclusions. A modified Swing equation with forced oscillation
    and nonlinear damping is proposed, using the Lagrangian of the system derived
    from the maximum entropy principle. Statistical Mechanics preserves the Swing
    equation for power systems subjected to forced oscillations. The modified Swing
    equation is numerically integrated for various external load conditions, including
    constant, step, periodic, and stochastic loads. The steady state and transient
    stability of the system are determined by the load nature, magnitude, and damping.

- name: Is my research used in clinical trials? - Tool(s) to assess societal impact
    using open scholarly data
  description: In the past, researchers have relied on commercial databases for scholarly
    information such as citations. With the acceleration of open science, open scholarly
    databases have emerged providing access to everyone for free. However, where commercial
    providers add a layer of abstraction in the form of aggregations and scientometrics,
    users of open scholarly data are confronted with raw data that can be difficult
    to work with. As research intelligence, this is where we step in, aiming to turn
    raw data into useful information. While making custom reports and dashboards is
    time-consuming and incurs a cost, we are exploring ways to provide a basic set
    of open-source tools that can be used by everyone, without charge. Our proposal
    is a tool that allows researchers to check whether their (fundamental) research
    is being cited by clinical trials. While traditionally only the number of citations
    has been used to establish impact of a publication, we aim to provide a more inclusive
    measure of societal impact by investigating the citation network. We will also
    explore ways to disseminate impact e.g. through visualisations. This implementation
    will pave the way for a series of similar tools that promote the recognition of
    research on various levels.

- name: Assessing the Zinc Finger Protein Mutation and Expression Profile in Kenyan
    Women with Breast Cancer
  description: The most recent evidence (2021) shows that breast cancer is the second
    leading cause of death in Kenyan women, after cervical cancer. Zinc Finger Proteins
    (ZNFs) have been shown to play a role in the progression of various types of cancers,
    including breast cancer. However, the impact of various types of mutations on
    breast cancer progression and prognosis have not been established in the Kenyan
    population. Lack of comprehensive knowledge on specific mutations within ZNFs
    703,750 and 213 in breast cancer among Kenyan women population has hindered the
    development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this population.

    actually different versions of it used by different software packages. I want
    to unify those. This also includes cross-referencing / integrating other databases
    to exploit division of labor. Further, I want the project to provide a blueprint
    on how to set-up databases with no cost for infrastructure / developer capacity,
    given a specific set of technological skills. Currently I see three big problems:
    1) create a FAIR representation of the data, 2) enable the community curation
    technologically, 3) motivate the community to invest work in the database. In
    the OLS Open Seeds program, I want to focus on problems 2) and 3).'

- name: Making corporate social responsibility data available and accessible for other
    researchers
  description: Since 1995, the Center for Philanthropic Studies at VU Amsterdam has
    conducted a biennial survey measuring corporate social responsibility in the Netherlands.
    The survey includes questions on corporate philanthropy in the form of giving
    money, goods and services to charitable causes, sponsorships of organizations,
    corporate volunteering, and corporate social responsibility behavior, among other
    topics. The thirteen waves of data have been collected for the Giving in the Netherlands
    (“Geven in Nederland”) series, which reports macro-economic estimates of the size,
    composition and trends in philanthropy. The data are rich and unique; they contain
    extensive information about corporate giving, volunteering and social responsibility
    as well as background information for large samples of the for-profit landscape
    in the Netherlands (total n ≈ 12,000). The data have not been documented for external
    use. As a result, the data have unused potential. The goal of the current project
    is to make the data publicly available in line with the FAIR principles in a repository
    that can be used for future editions of the survey.

- name: 'Gender Differences in the Impostor Phenomenon: A Preregistered and Open-Science
    Meta-Analysis'
  description: The impostor phenomenon (IP) refers to self-doubts about one’s abilities
    and difficulty internalizing individual accomplishments. These individuals attribute
    their success to external (e.g., oversight or luck), instead of internal (e.g.,
    intelligence or competence) factors. Therefore, they are worried that they will
    be found out as intellectual frauds or “impostors”. This phenomenon was first
    described by Clance and Imes in 1978 and received great attention over the last
    decades. Although initial researchers suggested that especially women suffer from
    the impostor phenomenon, more recent empirical evidence regarding gender differences
    is mixed. The aim of the current meta-analysis is to examine whether or not there
    are gender differences in the impostor phenomenon to examine where these potential
    gender differences come from moderation and mediation analysis. When conducting
    the meta-analysis, we want to follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
    reviews and Meta-Analysis for Protocols (PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015) and use
    the PRISMA-P templates developed by Moreau and Gamble (2022). We will preregister
    our study by uploading these templates (e.g., hypotheses, article searching strategies,
    screening criteria, codebook) and share all study materials and data via the Open
    Science Framework. We will also keep a logbook to track all details of our project.

- name: UbuntuEdu (Concept title)
  description: I aspire to develop an e-learning platform inspired by Udemy that specifically
    caters to African individuals, enabling them to upload courses in their native
    languages. The primary objective of this platform is to promote mother tongue
    education and offer e-learning opportunities for Africans seeking courses developed
    by their fellow Africans. Extensive research has consistently demonstrated the
    advantages of mother tongue education, such as increased literacy rates, enhanced
    critical thinking abilities, and elevated levels of cognitive processing. While
    my ultimate vision is to serve the entire African continent, I plan to initiate
    this endeavor by focusing on South African languages. Accomplishing this goal
    will entail fostering a sense of community, engaging with educators including
    teachers, lecturers, and professors, as well as actively involving the general
    public to encourage content creation and course material publication. While platforms
    like MijnNederlands have been successfully established for specific languages
    like Dutch, to the best of my knowledge, no such platform currently exists for
    African languages. Building this platform will undoubtedly be an immense undertaking,
    but upon completion of this mentorship program, my aim is to have developed the
    website and initiated the process of community building.

- name: Building a Searchable Open Data Repository of DNA Collections that are Freely-Shared
    under OpenMTA, with an Associated Landscape Map Visualisation of the Collection
    Users
  description: The documentation for the Open DNA Collections currently exist in multiple
    formats, and across three different platforms (the Open Bioeconomy Lab website,
    Freegenes website, and as collections on Addgene). Despite being a free and open
    resource, the dispersed nature of the available data makes it difficult for new
    users to understand which to use, and where to find the most up-to-date information.
    This project aims to gather all the disparate resources together, reformat the
    collections into a more standardised data structure, and produce a searchable/FAIR
    database on the Reclone.org website (the stewarding organisation) to make the
    collections more informative and accessible for new and old users alike. The outputs
    of this open data repository project will complement an existing Reclone project
    that aims to establish Regional Reagent Distribution Hubs in partner institutes
    (in Argentina, Ghana, and the Philippines) for sharing the physical DNA collections,
    and to help with capacity building within these institutes and local researchers.
    A parallel project goal would be to produce a landscape analysis and visualisation
    map of the current DNA Collections users to help future users in identifying local
    researchers within the Reclone community who may be able to better support their
    use of the collections.

- name: Developing an Open Community Repository for SciArt
  description: In recent years, the traditional dichotomy between art and science
    has been increasingly challenged by initiatives and programs (e.g., online resources,
    mixer programs, “SciArt” projects) that question the rigid definition of either
    field. These endeavours strive to establish a decentralised collaborative environment
    where artists and scientists can come together, encouraging them to reconsider
    and redefine their identities and practices. As part of the open science effort
    to make scientific data widely available, this project aims to create an Open
    Community Repository for deposition of raw scientific images. Scientific images
    are often not accessible to the general audience, educators, and visual artists
    whose work would benefit from images that portray real scientific spaces, methods,
    data, and discoveries. We envision that an open repository dedicated to raw scientific
    images could strengthen collaborations between artists and scientists and kickstart
    new SciArt partnerships.

- name: Assessing word stability in Corpora and its influence on learner dictionaries
  description: The task of assessing word stability in corpora through addition and
    removal of words is an important process which can influence which words should
    be in included or omitted in leaner dictionaries. The aim of the project is to
    investigate the stability of words in corpora when words are either removed or
    added, to gain insights into how word frequency distributions found in corpora
    have an influence on the outcome of learner’s dictionaries. The Oxford and McMillan
    dictionaries have top 3 000 words they deem important, and this project seeks
    to follow that example and assess the influence on word selection for learner
    dictionaries.

- name: A Fiji plugin for SOFI analysis
  description: Fluorescence microscopy has significantly contributed to our understanding
    of cellular processes in recent decades. The development of advanced super-resolution
    (SR) microscopy techniques has allowed for the examination of cellular structures
    at the nanoscale. SOFI (Super resolution optical fluctuation imaging method) is
    an SR method which uses the intensity fluctuations from single emitter and can
    provide higher resolution even using a couple of hundreds frame from wide-field
    image. However its analysis are mostly limited with scripted code and is not accessible
    enough of biologist. Creating an fiji plugin is important to help biologists and
    spread the method to different research fields.

- name: 'The invisible society: Misgendering in Facial Recognition Systems:'
  description: 'Gender is a deeply ingrained constructs in human culture and societies.
    It permeates our everyday activities, whether real or virtual, from social interactions
    to our digital lives. By nature, the most significant aspects of culture are reflected
    in scientific progress, determining its development and evolution. The way technological
    change is shaped and structured is thus inherently grounded in societal norms
    and relations, which are themselves equally affected by technological transformations.
    In this sense, the relationship among technology and gender can be considered
    as mutually constitutive. This relationship is leading to at least two main consequences:
    i) individuals increasingly encounter representations of gender embedded in technology;
    ii) machines are being trained to recognize and react to relevant traits of human
    identity, including gender. These consequences are made even more evident by the
    increasingly pervasive use of Automatic Face Analysis Systems (AFAS), especially
    when those systems are based on face recognition. However, these systems are consistently
    built on a gender binary construct and almost never take into account non-binary
    individuals, causing exclusion and reinforce existing prejudices about these communities.
    The project will break this barrier by analysing how algorithms (un)recognize
    non-binary faces, to foster the development of inclusive, diverse and trustworthy
    AI.'

  description: This project aims to investigate the diversity of bacterial pathogens
    associated with yellowing diseased coconuts along the Kenyan coast. The study
    will employ a combination of culture-independent methods and NGS techniques for
    bacterial identification. DNA extraction will be performed using CTAB method,
    followed by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq platform. The obtained
    sequence data will be analyzed using the Qiime2 pipeline. To accurately detect
    and classify genetic variants, machine learning models including XgBoost, LightGBM,
    and Random Forest will be trained using Python. The proposed research will shed
    light on the pathogenic bacteria associated with coconut diseases and facilitate

- name: Open-source handbooks infrastructure at VU Amsterdam
  description: Inspired by the Privacy Handbook (https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/dataprivacyhandbook/about.html
    ) developed by Utrecht University, colleagues from VU Amsterdam want to create
    guides on various Research Data Management topics for their own organization.
    We take the Privacy Handbook and the Turing Way as examples for our work. The
    goal of the project is to work out the infrastructure which is necessary for a
    collaboration. We need a template that the team will be able to maintain. We also
    develop a governance model and contribution guidelines that will make it possible
    to keep the handbooks as up to date collaborative resources developed and maintained
    beyond departmental boundaries.

- name: An online repository of tools and methods for automated archaeological survey
  description: The aim of this project is to build an online repository which will
    improve accessibility to automated methods for detecting archaeological features
    in remote sensing data. The online repository will primarily act as a model garden
    for archaeological computer vision models, but will also contain example notebooks
    sharing basic workflows that can be reproduced. I have agreements in place with
    vision model developers that will allow me to build on their existing technical
    work to provide the initial set of models. This project is aimed at stakeholders
    who are (1) interested in gaining an overview of technical research, (2) interested
    in understanding what is involved in the technical implementation of automated
    methods, or (3) actively looking for models to apply in their own work. In its
    first iteration, the model garden will be focused on vision models for archaeological
    survey but could be expanded in the future to include models for application to
    different areas of archaeological practice. If possible, and if necessary for
    the first prototype of the repository, I would also like to collaborate with the
    Turing's Scivision project to build on their existing catalogue infrastructure
    to provide access to the models.

- name: 'Open Science in Neuroscience: A Practical Guide for Researchers'
  description: 'Our project aims to develop an innovative and comprehensive Open Science
    guidebook specifically designed for the neuroscience field, addressing the knowledge
    gaps and lack of guidance that hinder the implementation of open science(OS) practices
    among researchers. The guidebook will serve as a go-to resource for researchers,
    providing them with the necessary knowledge and practical tools to incorporate
    OS principles into their work. It will offer clear and step-by-step guidance on
    various aspects of OS, such as data management, pre-registration, sharing protocols,
    analyzing code, and publishing open access. What sets our guidebook apart is its
    tailored approach to the neuroscience field. Recognizing the diverse subfields
    and unique challenges within neuroscience research, we will curate and consolidate
    existing resources while also developing new content that specifically addresses
    these considerations. Moreover, this guidebook will offer easily accessible guidance
    to researchers at all levels: students, early-career scientists, and established
    professionals alike. It will serve as a valuable resource, supporting them in
    adopting OS practices and fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency
    within the neuroscience community Overall, our project aims to bridge the gap
    between knowledge and implementation, empowering neuroscience researchers to embrace
    OS and contribute to the advancement of their field.'

- name: Estructura e infraestructura para la formación por cohortes virtuales
  description: Como parte de nuestro trabajo en la construcción de capacidades científicas
    y técnicas en forma responsable y con una mirada local, en MetaDocencia ofrecemos
    cursos virtuales y gratuitos para la comunidad hispanohablante. A partir de la
    adjudicación de tres subsidios TOPST de NASA y trabajando en conjunto con OLS
    y 2i2c, dos organizaciones con intereses afines, migraremos hacia la organización
    de cohortes virtuales de formación enfocadas en ciencia abierta. Este proyecto
    busca explorar las alternativas disponibles para organizar cohortes virtuales
    efectivas y avanzar en el diseño y la implementación de una hoja de ruta que facilite
    la migración de MetaDocencia hacia esta alternativa de entrenamiento, sirviendo
    también como referencia para otras organizaciones con intereses similares.

- name: Gobernanza 2.0 de MetaDocencia
  description: 'En 2022 comenzamos un proceso de aprendizaje colectivo y colaborativo
    para diseñar la gobernanza de MetaDocencia. El objetivo fue elaborar un modelo
    transparente para la toma de decisiones estratégicas, pensado desde y para nuestro
    contexto cultural y regional. Para ello, definimos una modalidad de trabajo interna
    y un método de votación para la toma de decisiones por acuerdo mayoritario y de
    forma democrática. Discutimos, consensuamos y actualizamos nuestra misión y visión,
    para que reflejen con mayor fidelidad nuestra propuesta actual. Como resultado
    del proceso, quedaron establecidos órganos de funcionamiento y reglamentos internos,
    junto a roles ejecutivos, responsabilidades y funciones de quienes lideran cada
    equipo. La puesta en práctica de nuestra nueva gobernanza comenzó en diciembre
    de 2022, con la conformación de un nuevo Consejo Asesor (CA) con estructura y
    roles ampliados, y la convocatoria a una primera reunión de acuerdo a los principios
    de funcionamiento actualizados. En este proyecto nos proponemos completar la gobernanza
    de MetaDocencia formalizando y documentando las siguientes secciones: Pautas de
    Convivencia (PdC). Política de Conflicto de Interés (COI). Política Editorial
    Abierta (PEA). Plan para la revisión anual de nuestra gobernanza.'
