- name: 'Building a Community of a Critical mass of Bioinformaticians in Nigeria:
    Leveraging Open Science Principles'
  description: This project aims to build a critical mass of bioinformaticians in
    Nigeria by leveraging open science principles to address the current expertise
    deficit in the field. We plan to establish a robust community through a combination
    of training workshops, mentorship programs, and the development of open-access
    resources. Key activities include organizing workshops to equip participants with
    essential bioinformatics and open science skills and knowledge, creating resources
    that will help the community adapt open science tenets to their work and launching
    an open training and mentorship program to connect enthusiast with experienced
    with professionals. By fostering a culture of openness, we aim to enhance the
    quality and reproducibility of scientific research in Nigeria, encouraging collaboration
    and continuous learning. This initiative will create a sustainable ecosystem of
    professionals capable of driving innovation and contributing to global scientific
    advancements, ultimately bridging the expertise gap and promoting a more inclusive
    scientific community.

- name: Developing a genetic information management system towards precision medicine
  description: Without such a tool, implementation of precision medicine is difficult
    if not impossible. Existing genetic information management tools are subscribed
    for, which pushes the genotyping service way up. Guidelines in common use were
    developed mostly using genetic and phenotypic information from other population
    that are not of African ancestry, making the generalisation of the recommendations
    difficult and less useful. The proposed project aims to address these shortcomings
    by taping into the wealth of genetic information and lessons learnt on African
    populations ignorer to make the solution relevant to Africa, and Zimbabwe in particular.

- name: 'TidyScreen: managing large drug screening campaigns'
  description: Research efforts oriented towards the virtual screening of drugs encompasses
    the work with huge chemical libraries covering a massive chemical space. The nature
    of this chemical space is mainly governed by the biophysical features of the therapeutic
    target in study, as well as the synthetic protocols envisioned to obtain new drug
    candidates. In this way, a plethora of Python packages have been developed in
    order to solve different problems related to the associated screening workflows.
    However most of the available solutions as Python packages for the work with chemistry
    problems functions in an isolated manner, and generates a vast amount of information
    in heterogeneous ways. In this context, developing systematic and organized approaches
    to perform such scientific explorations, involving the development of reproducible
    and adequately organized data processing and storing workflows within structured
    query databases maximizes the success rate of drug discovery research campaigns.
    This project is oriented towards generating this kind of solutions, allowing both
    new and experienced researchers to perform adequately designed and reproducible
    virtual drug screening campaigns.

- name: Building a Collaborative Network to Advance Bioimaging in Latin America
  description: LABI is a regional network that promotes bioimaging in Latin America.
    We are dedicated to building capacity and fostering collaboration in the region.
    Through training programs, professional development and opening access to infrastructure,
    we seek to democratize knowledge and technology in bioimaging. Our goal is to
    foster scientific research and technological innovation, promoting quality standards
    and best practices in the use of imaging technologies. In addition, we facilitate
    the exchange of knowledge and experiences among researchers and technicians from
    the region and the world. We work in close collaboration with academic institutions,
    research centers, companies and international organizations to advance the field
    of bioimaging and contribute to scientific and technological progress in Latin
    America.

- name: MolerHealth
  description: The Molerhealth project aims to revolutionize healthcare in Nigeria
    by developing an open-source electronic health records (EHR) application. This
    initiative addresses the critical issue of disease misdiagnosis by enhancing information
    sharing and collaboration among healthcare providers, leading to better patient
    outcomes and a more efficient healthcare system. Molerhealth offers a secure,
    user-friendly platform for individuals to access, update, and share their comprehensive
    health records, regardless of location or healthcare provider. This EHR system
    ensures seamless continuity of care by making patients' medical history, test
    results, medications, allergies, and treatment plans readily available to healthcare
    professionals. Leveraging technology, Molerhealth will significantly reduce misdiagnoses
    in Nigeria. Doctors will access complete, up-to-date patient profiles, enabling
    accurate diagnoses, appropriate treatments, and timely specialist referrals.

- name: DECIPHERING THE ROLE OF PHOSPHAaTIDYLETHANOLAMINE TRANSFERASE (PEMT) IN GLIOBLASTOMA
    MULTIFORME CELL INVASION, PROLIFERATION AND AGGRESSION
  description: 'Introduction: Cancer cells reorganize their metabolism to sustain
    cell growth and adapt to unfavorable microenvironments. Kang and colleagues (2018)
    state that metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells result in diverse metabolic
    dependent perturbations that may be targeted for cancer treatment. Generally,
    for instance, lipid metabolism powers the rapid growth, migration, invasion, and
    metastasis of tumor cells (Cheng et al., 2016). Nonetheless, little is known about
    the functions of PEMT in tumor aggression, especially in GBM. Therefore, we hypothesize
    that PEMT contributes greatly to increased GBM invasion, proliferation and aggression
    capacities. Methods: To investigate the role of PEMT in GBM aggressiveness, we
    cloned the PEMT gene into U251 cell lines to overexpress the gene shRNA-mediated
    knockdown to silence the gene. Overexpression (OE) and knockdown (KD) were validated
    by microscopy, WB and RT-PCR. We conducted functional assays including, cell proliferation
    and cell viability. Subsequently, we confirmed epithelial-mesenchymal transition
    (EMT) driving markers by RT-PCR and WB.'

- name: Enhancing Openness in the Prediction of Bacterial Pathogens in Yellowing Disease
    of Coastal Kenyan Coconuts through Machine Learning
  description: The project focuses on leveraging machine learning to predict bacterial
    pathogens responsible for the yellowing disease in coastal Kenyan coconuts. By
    developing an open-source platform, we aim to foster collaboration, transparency,
    and community engagement in agricultural research. The project involves creating
    an open-access database of bacterial pathogens and coconut plant health data,
    which researchers and agricultural professionals can use and contribute to. We
    will develop machine learning algorithms for pathogen identification and disease
    prediction, providing valuable tools for proactive disease management. A user-friendly
    web-based platform will ensure easy access to data and tools, catering to users
    with varying technical expertise. This project enhances research capabilities,
    empowers local communities with predictive models, promotes openness and collaboration,
    and builds capacity through training and educational resources. The goal is to
    create a collaborative environment where knowledge is share
