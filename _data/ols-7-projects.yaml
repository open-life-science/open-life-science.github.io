- name: Collective and Open Research in Climate Science
  description: The idea is to facilitate the creation of an environment (a working group or a community, eventually)
    where researchers, students, citizen scientists can collaborate on projects, research projects, articles or just share
    their work based on open science principles.
    There are examples of open research environments in the scientific community, in particular in the machine learning field.
    Examples are [mlcollective](https://mlcollective.org/), [Machine Learning Tokyo](https://machinelearningtokyo.com/) and 
    [Neuromatch Academy](https://academy.neuromatch.io/).
    Those communities run by volunteers created a friendly environment and study groups for machine learning practitioners and also
    curricula to introduce students to data science.
    In e.g., the [mlcollective](https://mlcollective.org/projects/) effort led to the publication of many projects.
    Eventually, these examples could be used to create or simply design (white paper/report) a similar project in other research areas.

- name: Implementing Facial Recognition and Biometric Attendance Monitoring in Educational and Corporate Settings
  description: This project aims to design and implement a system for tracking attendance
    using facial recognition or biometric technology in educational and corporate
    settings. The project will begin by reviewing current attendance tracking systems
    and analyzing various facial recognition and biometric technologies. Based on
    this analysis, a suitable technology will be chosen and a prototype system will
    be developed. The project will also consider the ethical and privacy implications
    of using such technology and develop strategies to mitigate any potential risks.
    The end result will be a functional system for tracking attendance and a report
    detailing the technical, ethical, and privacy considerations involved. This system
    will provide a reliable and efficient solution for tracking attendance in educational
    and corporate settings while addressing ethical and privacy concerns.

- name: 'From invisible to Citizens: Apparent Age for Primary School children without birth certificates'
  description: Ages fraud scandals have tarnished African sport at the international
    level. In 2009, FIFA adopted MRI as an age determination tool for its youth level
    competitions but recent studies show that bone age assessment has a very large
    margin of error and cannot be a standard for determining apparent age when we
    know that environmental factors greatly influence the development of the child.
    There are populations in which the disappearance of growth cartilage is 4 to 5
    years earlier than in another. The ugly face of the problem is that many children
    are born out of the healthcare system.  In Cameroon, approximately 1.7 million
    children, or 66 %, do not have a birth certificate. These children are said to
    be "invisible" In other words, they live without being recognised by the country
    whose citizenship they claim.  According to a study carried out by Unicef, 40,000
    children, in the Far North region alone, will find it difficult to present their
    end of year First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) for lack of a birth certificate.
    To establish these birth certificates, it will be necessary to make an estimate
    of their apparent age in a complex process which discourages parents. It is evident
    that the determination of apparent age should not only be seen from a clinical
    standpoint. Instead, socio-cultural and environment factors must also be taken
    into account. To remedy this situation which has reached the alert level, it is
    urgent to propose a simplified and open system for determining Apparent Age to
    turn invisible kids to visible ones based on available Data and Machine Learning
    techniques.

  description: The core idea of this project is to create an online repository that
    hosts as well as examples, datasets and demos for soil science data management.
    Stakeholders will include early soil scientists who are not familiar with programming,
    task automatization and open science principles. Overall, we plan to develop online
    materials that help students to understand how open science + use of scripts +
    soil science can be merge and create a skillset that is essential in research.

    projects, actions and problems is a key point to achieve this objective. Today,
    with so much information available, but at the same time dispersed in different
    platforms, there is more than ever a need to concentrate and centralize it, so
    that it is easily accessible. In this text the fundamental concepts that define
    us will be explained and we will present the first version of a web tool, which
    manages to provide information on different socio-environmental projects and detail
    them in an Interactive Map idealy managed by contributing users.

- name: Knowledge and perspectives of open science among researchers in Ghana, West Africa
  description: 'Open Science in Africa: The Ghanaian narrative. UNESCO and its stakeholders
    perceive the Open Science concept as an essential component to advancement of  human
    development through increasing accessibility of the scientific process. To that
    end, UNESCO has adopted the Open Science recommendations in 2021 to define shared
    values and principles for OS, identify concrete measures towards OS and provide
    an international framework for OS policy and practice. However, uptake and adoption
    of open science in Africa and for that matter, Ghana, has been low, denying researchers
    and the country in general benefits that the practices accrue. The goal of this
    project is  to assess the knowledge base, understanding and perception of open
    science in the Ghanaian research  space while considering the challenges faced
    by researchers practising open science. Findings of this study will help establish
    gaps in practising open science by researchers and advise areas of intervention.'

- name: Open Science platform for humanities and computational social scientists
  description: Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role in openly sharing scientific knowledge
    with a worldwide audience (among both academic and non-academic audiences) and
    encouraging reproducibility. But OD is much less developed in Humanities and Social
    Science (HSS) research, primarily because of the levels of sensitivity of the
    data involved, and consent required from participants, which could be difficult
    for researchers, especially if they are new to data sharing. With the growing
    interest in computing, researchers working in Computational Social Science (CSS)
    face similar issues when working with social data in their research, while conforming
    to legal and ethical restrictions. As per OD guidelines, data must comply with
    the FAIR principles. But the metrics offered by various OD repositories and publication
    platforms could be different, which limits the affordances of social activity
    and the type of OD published.   To embrace Open Science projects among HSS and
    CSS researchers who are working or looking to work with sensitive data, this project
    proposes a platform (or hub) to promote free, online resources for both professionals
    and students looking to learn about science and ethics. Here, they can also contribute
    to discussions related to the topic, post questions, and learn from others' experiences.

  description: Neuroscience is a vast field of research, ranging from single – cell
    recordings in animals and primates to electrophysiological and behavioural research
    in humans and work with patients suffering of brain diseases. This big and diverse
    field has the unifying goal of studying the underlying structure and function
    of the brain and uncovering its secrets. Each of the areas in neuroscience use
    a variety of research practices and while the results they yield are qualitatively
    different, their ultimate integration towards answering the big ‘how the brain
    works’ question, is of paramount importance.  Open science has a big role to play
    in this exchange and integration of information.   Towards that end I would like
    to examine closely the degree that the practices of Open Science are used in each
    of the main areas of Neuroscience and write a scientific report. This report will
    include literature review, examples of specific cases that Open Science practices
    are already being used as well as challenges that researchers may be facing while
    applying these practices in a day to day basis. Finally, the report will conclude
    with final remarks and future directions.

- name: 'Ethical Implications of Open Source AI: Transparency and Accountability'
  description: Exploring the ethical implications of open-source AI is a topic that
    deals with understanding the potential consequences of making AI systems and their
    underlying data and algorithms available to the public.   One of the main ethical
    implications of using AI is that it can potentially lead to bias and discrimination,
    as the data and algorithms used to train these systems may reflect societal biases.
    Additionally, open data could also raise concerns about data privacy, as the release
    of sensitive data could lead to negative consequences for individuals and organizations.  However,
    open source AI can also be used to promote transparency and accountability in
    AI systems. Making the data and algorithms used to train AI systems publicly available,
    allows for greater oversight and monitoring of these systems to ensure that they
    are not being used in unethical or harmful ways. Additionally, open source AI
    can also foster community development and collaboration, allowing for transparency,
    a wider range of perspectives and expertise to be brought to bear on the development
    and use of AI.  In summary, open source AI has both potential benefits and drawbacks
    and it is important to consider the ethical implications before implementing it.
    Therefore, responsible AI governance and social responsibility are crucial.

- name: Open educational hands-on tutorial for evaluating fairness in AI classification models
  description: The main objective of this project is to develop a **hands-on** tutorial
    for evaluating machine learning models *fairness* in different contexts. Specifically,
    to generate **open-source class material** (pipeline, slides, code) and a **trainer
    user guide** to develop and reproduce the tutorial. It is expected to be a ~3
    hours class where the tutor presents different datasets and different approaches
    of *fairness*. The analysis will focus on **understanding which definition of
    *fairness*** is appropriate in each context; to understand the relations between
    the selected evaluation method and the implications they could have to disadvantage
    groups when deployed.   On one hand, the focus will be on **alerting and understanding
    how to evaluate *fairness*** and, on the other hand, **how to do it using open-source
    libraries**. The code part will be developed on Python using mainly Scikit-Learn
    and Fairlearn open-source libraries.

- name: Comparison of three growth curves for the diagnosis of extrauterine growth retardation at 40 weeks postconceptional age and associated factors in preterm infants in the city of Yaoundé, Cameroon
  description: Extra-uterin growth retardation (EUGR) is defined as weight or height
    below the 10th percentile relative to the mean for the child's age and sex at
    40 weeks post-conceptional  age. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    applicability of growth curves (Intergrowth -21, Fenton and WHO) for the assessment
    of extra-uterin growth at 40 weeks post-conceptional age and the factors associated
    with extra-uterin growth retardation in preterm infant in Cameroon. This will
    be an analytical study of all low birth weight preterm mother-infant pairs present
    in referral hospitals in the city of Yaoundé whose mothers have given their consent
    to participate in the study between June 2022 and March 2023. For the diagnosis
    of EUGR and its associated factors, we will first take the anthropometric parameters
    of the children at birth at 36 and at 40 PCA as well as information on the parents
    or their environment. At the end of this analysis, we will be able to choose the
    appropriate curve for the evaluation of the extra-uterin growth of preterm infants
    with low birth weight in Yaoundé and to determine the factors associated with
    the EUGR.

- name: Euro-BioImaging Scientific Ambassadors Program
  description: Euro-BioImaging (https://www.eurobioimaging.eu/) is a research infrastructure
    that offers open access to imaging technologies, training, and data services in
    biological and biomedical imaging. Euro-BioImaging consists of imaging facilities,
    called ‘Nodes’, that have opened their doors to all life science researchers.
    There are informal community leads within the nodes’ staff and users that often
    raise awareness about Euro-BioImaging and the provided services. However, there
    is no official program at the moment that acknowledges them as formal ambassadors.  This
    project aims at launching a Scientific Ambassadors Program for Euro-BioImaging,
    which will officially reward such contributions and encourage new leads to emerge
    in the community.

- name: 'momenTUM Research Platform: An open-source, reproducible research infrastructure for digital health'
  description: Over the past year, we built the new research platform **[momenTUM](https://www.momentumresearch.eu/)**,
    which consists of an iOS/Android app for delivering interventions and questionnaires
    to participants in research studies and server software to configure trials, accept
    data and register them into a REDCap server. Based on the previously developed
    [schema-app](https://github.com/schema-app/schema), the app uses reproducible
    JSON files to specify the timing, order and properties of interventions and questionnaires
    sent to the end-user device. We are beginning to use momenTUM in our research
    studies examining human sleep and circadian physiology and believe it will be
    valuable to the scientific community. Currently, while there are various commercial
    and sometimes pricy solutions to design smartphone-based interventions, we believe
    that developing an open-source solution is the right thing to do. Our diverse
    team – consisting of two software developers and two researchers – shares this
    ethos. Through our participation in OLS-7, we will advance our project, grow our
    network and learn how to build a community around the project.

- name: Investigating effective strategies for radical inclusion at academic events
  description: 'We are a group of researchers from the University of Oxford looking
    to establish a discussion about pushing the boundaries of what it means to host
    an inclusive academic event. This discussion cannot happen in a vacuum and we
    are mindful of our limited experience and expertise in this space. As such, we
    intend to take a proactive stance and give voice to thoughts, opinions and lived
    experiences of conference organisers and attendees with inclusivity concerns.  We
    intend to work towards a publication which is a compilation of our investigation
    into multiple mediums for collecting viewpoints, debate and strategic implementations.
    As a first step in achieving this aim and an effective pilot of the discussion
    points, we have recently hosted our first round of focus groups where we addressed
    the following topics: * Who are we not seeing at conferences, and what would it
    actually take to get them there? * Implementation of considerations for constantly
    changing and sensitive geopolitical issues? * Support for visas and other regulatory
    considerations  * Enforcement of harassment policies and embedding of harassment
    prevention methods at the earliest planning stages  Through this endeavour, we
    connected with interesting and passionate people. We set up a mailing list where
    we share regular updates on the ongoing work, and excitingly, we have a list of
    people potentially interested in collaborating on this project. We hope to draw
    on their perspectives and experiences in developing a publication and any other
    potential outputs that will help incite real, tangible change in the space of
    academic events.'

  description: 'For an AI framework with a queer perspective from the Majority World
    that is going to be used by technologists, final users, policymakers, sociologists,
    activists, and everyone involved with Artificial Intelligence, we must consider
    using a common language in all stages of the foundation of any AI: design, development,
    deployment, and detection of biases. Furthermore, this common language should
    go around the concepts of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics because
    of actions those could bring in setting the AI foundation and making them less
    harmful for queer people from the Majority World.   This is going to demand that
    all of us involved in this process think outside the box and bring queer, Majority
    World theories, methods, and methodologies, also the use of MLP, NLP, neurosciences,
    and trans theories from the majority world, body theories, cultural studies as
    a methodology, interviews, focus groups, participatory design, documentary, or
    case analysis, field research, law-making, regulatory processes, and others, altogether
    creating this framework.   It is understandable, needs to include the language
    that can transform this specific harmful stereotype into regulations, formal definitions,

- name: The Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Mental Health
  description: Millennials and Gen Zs recently have become obsessed with being online
    and informed 24/7 so much that it has encroached on sleep time. We tend to attach
    more importance to skin care, beauty products, exercise and many others ways to
    live healthy but fail to acknowledge the importance of a good night rest. The
    need for sleep tends to be underestimated.  With the evidence garnered from cumulative
    research works, one can boldly assert that sleep deprivation has a profound effect
    on one’s health. This project pays particular attention to the negative impacts
    of lack of sleep on mental health.  Thus, the work will include various sleep
    disorders, and other causes of sleep loss. It will touch on the normal sleep cycle
    and factors that distort this cycle. The aim is to provide adequate evidence to
    enable people make an informed decision about getting better sleep.

  description: This project is to help every user, be it parents, children or other
    adults wishing to follow a particular career path find the right pattern towards
    achieving their life goals. The platform uses the top-down or bottom-up approach
    to achieve this goal. Using the top-down approach, a user can be interested in
    a particular field, say Artificial intelligence. The user then keys in the word
    artificial intelligence and the system gives a detailed guide of all that is required
    of the field such as academic qualifications needed/natural skills needed too.
    The program also includes various study programs, schools, scholarships etc, differentiating
    if it is remote, onsite and hybrid taking note of the locations of the available
    programs. Each program will also have fees allocation and other details provided
    by the dataset fed into the system. Statistics such as average salary, working
    hours etc will also be provided, and related fields as well, which if a user clicks,
    it will redirect to the clicked field.  The bottom up approach uses qualifications
    be it academic or natural to direct an individual towards available careers for
    that qualification. Say a student just had the Advanced level passing Biology,
    chemistry, computer science and maths. The system will also prompt the student
    to give in natural qualifications such as great organizational skills, working
    alone or in team, interpersonal skills etc, from which a roadmap to the various
    available careers based on those qualifications will be given as a guide for the
    student to follow. Other information such as scholarship opportuinities, internships,
    schools, programmes etc will be given in the system as well.   This system is
    to take data from contributors all over the world, and updates will be made every
    now and then to ensure arcuracy of the data.

- name: 'Closer to the sky: co-creating astronomical knowledge in a favela of Rio de Janeiro'
  description: '“Closer to the sky” is an astronomy public engagement project in Rio
    de Janeiro, Brazil that builds upon workshops for children based on the practice
    of non-violence developed by the astronomy club, initiated by A. Cortesi and C.
    Araujo. It entails two parts: 1) The collective exploration of astronomical images
    and space-based images of Earth (available from open access databases) with children,
    artists and people in a favela (slum) in Rio. Children will use space imagery
    to create poems, music, performances and street art together with local artists,
    to promote a positive and healthy vision of their environment. By exploring images
    with computers at the local cultural centre, they will practice digital skills
    while handling data containing information to observe the environment.  2) The
    creation of a digital map of cultural projects in Rio favelas, including the new
    artwork and educational material, along with locations linked to the history and
    practice of astronomy in the city.   The project is informed by different aspects
    of the Open Science framework, from opening a dialogue with the community to creating
    science and educational material together. The interactive map, all content, lessons
    learnt and documentation on how to run similar initiatives will be released as
    open source projects.'

- name: Mapping open-science communities, organizations, and events in Latin America
  description: This project aims to identify communities that actively participate
    in the **implementation, training, and dissemination of open practices** such
    as open access, open data, open science, and open educational resources in the
    **Latin American region**. We will create a **repository** that will collect **information
    regarding main areas, topics of expertise, and geographical location, as well
    as the contact information** of the identified organizations and communities.
    Then, we will create a **website or web-based application** that will feature
    a **searchable list and an interactive map interface**. Organizations interested
    in being added to the knowledge base will be able to do so through a pull request
    on GitHub. The project foresees an automatic update of the list and the map every
    time a pull request is approved after the new information is curated.

- name: Developing an online snake venomics catalog for easy access to venom proteomics data
  description: Snake venoms are incredibly complex mixtures of many different proteins
    called toxins. Understanding which particular toxins are in the venoms of each
    snake is important information for researchers working with snakes, particularly
    for those developing new anti-venoms against snakebite.  There have been many
    previous studies which have identified which toxins are in which snakes. This
    is incredibly valuable information for researchers, but the data is trapped in
    tables, scattered across many different scientific papers. These papers are themselves
    often trapped behind journal pay-walls.  In this project, I propose to; firstly,
    create a database of snake venom proteomics studies and secondly, create an online
    platform which will allow easy access to, and visualisation of, the proteins that
    have been identified in each snake venom. I hope to create a tool which will be
    useful to anyone interested in understanding snake venoms.

- name: Biodegradability of Drilling Fluids in different soil types
  description: Drilling fluid is a lubricant used in drilling oil and gas wells and
    in exploration rigs. It may vary with additives aimed at optimizing and improving
    the drilling process(Sadiq et al., 2003). They are mixture of natural and synthetic
    chemical compounds applied to cool and lubricate the drill bit; clean the borehole
    bottom; drive cuttings to the surface, control formation pressure and improve
    the function of the drill string and tools in the borehole (API, 1992).   The
    decline of the environment is presently a common and overwhelming challenge globally
    (Gazali et al., 2017). Studies have shown that uncontrolled disposal of drilling
    fluid wastes, with accompanying toxic components contribute heavily to the diminishing
    biodiversity (Vincent-Akpu, 2015; Vincent-Akpu and Sikoki, 2013; Sil et al., 2012).
    Most drilling firms especially on-shore, prefer to use land spraying (or throwing)
    as a method of disposing the waste drilling muds. Such unsustainable methods could
    lead to some hostile environmental impacts (Gazali et al., 2017). Yet, if biodegradation
    is relied on as a natural and cost-effective option for pollutant breakdown and
    pollution control (Nrior et al., 2017).  The aim of this study is to investigate
    the biodegradability of drilling fluid in the different soil types. This study,
    in addition to specifying the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants
    in the soil, will chiefly show which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling
    waste biodegradability and by implication provide reliable data for policy makers
    as regards to environmental reclamation

- name: Building an open, structured, knowledge listing system
  description: The project I have in mind for this program has 2 major components.   The
    first component is to build a resource listing system, likely based on Quarto
    (https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings-custom.html), that will take
    data from YAML files, and convert to a listing on a static web page that allows
    for filter and sorting. The openlifesci.org website actually does an incredible
    job of displaying structured lists that come from YAML, but uses Jekyll to do
    this.   I also intend to build out a system in GitHub actions that will accept
    and validate new entries that come through a form or GitHub Issues. The second
    component would be to create training program that teaches how to use the system
    -- while also teaching the concepts of version control, metadata schemas, and
    continuous integration to complete novices.

    \ and data  science framework. The project aims to expose secondary school students\
    \ \nin Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela to data science research  environments\
    \ and tools at an early age. Through the creation of research workshops and the\
    \ data generated in a network of weather stations,  students will be guided in\
    \ understanding open science concepts, climate  change, statistics and programming.\
    \ Ultimately, it is hoped that by \ncarrying out a project, the students will\
    \ be able to take action to  address the effects of climate change in their communities."
