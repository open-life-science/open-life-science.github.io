    Citizen science revolves around the idea of integrating the public
    in scientific research. However, there are different interpretations of this idea.
    An important part of citizen science projects allows laymen only to participate
    in a limited scope of microtasks and keeps thus reinforcing the power gap between
    academic scientists and the public. Literature has called for more autonomy of
    citizen scientists by allowing them to participate in more phases of the research
    cycle. Commons-based peer-production, an alternative mode of production in which
    people self-organize to develop complex knowledge-commons like Wikipedia or open
    software, seems to be a promising approach to facilitate this. However, a design-centred
    approach implementing this for a specific use case is yet to be done. In my PhD
    project I am trying to fill this gap by redesigning the online ecosystem of Open
    Humans - an existing community of practice around citizen science - collaborating
    closely with this community in a user-centered design approach. As one of the
    first steps, I am working on a best practices guide, summarizing the experiences
    of existing similar projects.

    a platform where survivors can submit video recordings of their own memories and
    reflections of the 1992 Homeland War. The repository will also store them in a
    publicly accessible database. By having the software be open to citizen scientists,
    the database will be one of the most inclusive and easily accessible memory banks.

    This project is a field and laboratory based research project researching,
    surveying, and discovering the palaeoecology and palaeogeography of West Cork.
    The project will make use of:- paper research methods; sampling and scientific
    analysis of sediments; digital mapping; field and site visits and landscape analysis;
    scientific processing, analysis and identification of microfossils from sediments;
    site visits and surveys; ecological surveys; and local enquiry. Results and findings
    will be published on a website in the form of:- stories, accounts, photographs,
    digital interactive maps, and graphics, with a prime emphasis on accessibility,
    understandability, relevance. Principal attention will be paid to environmental
    areas that are productive of microfossils (bog and lake sediments); that have
    distinctive landscape features and sediment types (relict glacial and past and
    present fluvial landscape features); different natural habitat types and plant
    and animal communities; geological distinctiveness; and archaeological sites.
    Emphasis will be placed on the interconnectedness of these aspects of the current
    and past environments. The final step will be to show how, in each area, however
    local, these many and varied aspects have contributed to the present landscape
    and environment and thus to give an understanding how the future development may
    progress.

    "Actigraphy provides a measure of the 24h rest-activity cycles based
    on movement counts, typically of the wrist. It is obtained using wearable devices
    and is a widely used, non-invasive way to determine sleep and circadian properties.
    Importantly, metrics derived from actigraphy are being increasingly used in clinical
    contexts, where groups of psychiatric and neurological patients in specific conditions
    have found to be exhibit abnormal rest-activity rhythms and sleep. Sleep and circadian
    parameters from actigraphy are derived measures. These are obtained by converting
    the movements counts (usually obtained at a resolution of 1 minutes) into sleep
    parameters and circadian metrics using  algorithms raging from threshold-based
    computations to machine learning techniques. Unfortunately, at present, there
    are no standards or schemas for specifying and sharing actigraphy data and corresponding
    algorithms.


    The goal of this project is to develop a common schema for the use, analysis,
    reporting and open and interoperable sharing of actigraphy data across different
    actigraphy devices produced by different commercial manufacturers and for use
    by researchers and research users. This project builds upon core research and
    technical expertise amongst the team members, and provides a framework to structure
    the work of the newly funded Chronobiology Data Standards Interest Group (CDSIG)."

    BioFerm is a web application platform which can be used for kinetic
    study, simulation and optimization of bioprocesses. The user is able to calculate
    the best initial conditions as well as overall operating conditions which will
    result in the highest product yield (or any user specified output). Kinetic modelling
    can also be done to further analyse the process and to calculate and estimate
    yield and kinetic parameters respectively. This allows the prediction of substrate,
    product and biomass concentrations over the bioprocess period. The BioFerm web
    application will be able to take in a variety of bioreactor configurations (batch,
    fed batch, continuous) and  fit the results to a variety of models(inhibition
    and non-inhibition) to return the above mentioned parameters. The software is
    currently being written in Python using an open-source app framework(streamlit)
    to run the app but will later be written using Django, also a popular web framework.

    Inspired by the social clubs founded by Benjamin Franklin, the Junto
    Labs initiative seeks to provide life science researchers with an online space
    for pursuing collaborative research and supporting active learning. Life science
    laboratories can be open and highly collaborative spaces for in person research,
    learning and discovery. While online tools, such as Git and Jupyter notebooks,
    help facilitate openness and reproducibility among peers, they can also provide
    a highly creative and flexible medium for designing interactive educational experiences.
    The Junto Labs initiative aims to create a catalog of Jupyter notebooks that exemplify
    how to design virtual environments optimized for conducting research, facilitating
    mentorship, and encouraging active learning. Researchers would be able to more
    easily collaborate on active projects, but also expand active learning opportunities
    for students who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in research.
    Importantly, life science laboratories could use the resource to design and provide
    research and mentorship opportunities to students from under-resourced communities
    or universities where opportunities to participate in life science research are
    limited or nonexistent.

    "The emergence of short-read NGS technologies have brought a profound
    knowledge to the field of microbial ecology/evolution through the taxonomic identification
    of microbial communities - metabarcoding. Although its main limitation resides
    on their short read-length that has been suppressed by long-read/real-time sequencing
    technologies such as Oxford Nanopore MinION. Currently, there are many standalone
    tools/algorithms to process this data inclusive bioinformatic pipelines but they
    lack a better integration. My proposal is the development of a modular python
    pipeline for nanopore metabarcoding data - metaNanoPype - with the following modules:
    (I) demultiplexing; (II) quality-assessment; (III) quality-filtering and trimming;
    (IV) taxonomic classification; (V) diversity analyses. Each module could include
    several options to allow flexibility. Each step could generate a log file used
    later to build a report in html/pdf format describing the versions, commands and
    references of software used. The report built would ensure reproducibility, transparency,
    acknowledgement and could be used as supplementary material of papers. metaNanoPype
    could be publicly available on github (open source) with further documentation

    The field of molecular biology is a concept to discover, identify and
    explain mechanisms of everything about DNA, RNA and protein level in a cell. Despite
    it is a relatively young discipline, its prominence in the life sciences is becoming
    more and more popular. Within the scope of my project, I aim to evaluate the paper
    on molecular biology studies and make them available for everyone. Choosing a
    weekly topic and summarizing it that everyone can understand is the main idea.
    As a workflow, I aim to write a brief introduction to introduce the paper and
    its authors, the purpose of the study, and present the results. Briefly, I would
    like to design a website which is publicly accessible. I aim to make this website
    as a resource for the academic community, students and all other folks who want
    to read and learn. At the same time, I plan to prepare a section where questions
    can be asked in order to share with other readers to make a discussing community
    about the related article. I want to provide a connection between students or
    researchers in this field of science to improve knowledge, share and even find
    new ideas.

    OLS is a great platform to open life science with the objective of
    train young researchers towards the practices in open science skills. I am a graduand
    of OLS-2 that recently concluded and coming out of that program I felt that there
    is tremendous value in the program. However, this might not be reaching out to
    as many as possible. I think, one way of the extending the outreach beyond what
    else has been done is perhaps to pen down the experience of the participants of
    the previous program. As a participant myself, I can see how there many ways,
    one could promote this and share the journey with the readers, especially with
    the young generation and highlight the essence of this program. Thus, I took it
    motivation to myself to contribute in this direction by re-joining the OLS-3 program
    and having this it self as a project with the goal of coming up as a tangible
    document in the form of a publication to be shared with the community at large.

    sktime is a new Python toolbox for machine learning with time series
    (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime). It provides state-of-the-art
    time series algorithms and scikit-learn compatible tools for building, tuning
    and evaluating complex models. The goal of this project is to improve sktime’s
    online documentation with a specific focus on documenting algorithm contributors.
    Algorithms form a major part of sktime. They require special expertise in their
    development and maintenance. We plan to enhance the existing documentation by
    making algorithm contributors more visible. The aim is (i) to make it easier for
    users and other developers to directly get in touch with the algorithm experts
    to ask questions or suggest code improvements and (ii) to recognize their contributions
    more visibly and formally to encourage long-term maintenance of their contributions.
    sktime has already defined a new community role as part of their governance guidelines
    to ensure that algorithm contributors have extra rights and responsibilities with
    regard to their algorithm. However, up-to-date documentation listing the current
    contributors and links to their algorithms is currently missing. Optionally, we
    can add other information like literature references. We plan to automate the
    generation of this documentation by making use of the existing documentation and
    other components such as CODEOWNERS file and __author__ strings in Python files.

    through the International Phytolith Society, have been promoted to standardise
    the phytolith analysis and the subsequent publication of data. However, the standardisation

    Obesity causes approximately 4.7 million premature deaths annually,
    which accounts for a loss of ca. 8% globally. Obesity is an outcome of complex,
    heritable, and multi-factorial interaction of multiple genes, environmental factors,
    and behavioral traits that makes management and prevention challenging in the
    human population (Rao et al., 2014). Experimental research has demonstrated that
    altered metabolites in multiple metabolic pathways are associated with obesity
    (Zhao et al.,2016). Alteration in the proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes
    in the gut microbiome can trigger obesity. The gut microbiome's influence on obesity
    is much more complicated than the imbalance of these bacteria species. Modulation
    of the gut microbiome through diet, prebiotics, surgery, and antibiotics significantly
    affects the obesity epidemic (John & Mullin, 2016). It is one of the enormous
    global health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality mediated
    by its association with several other metabolic disorders (Saini et al., 2018).
    We aim to target obesity and diabetes-associated metabolic disorders and annotate
    the genes common to these complex diseases using a systems genomic integrated
    approach, thereby using Galaxy as a platform.

    "Biological activity data was retrieved from the ChEMBL database and
    pre-processed by selecting the target which was SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase
    in the project and the data frame of the target protein was filtered by removing
    the molecules which do not have the standard type as IC50 and those having missing
    value for standard value.

    The data was distributed as active, inactive, and intermediate by the IC50  values.

    The SMILES notation (representing the unique chemical structure of compounds)
    from the dataset was used to compute the molecular descriptors.

    Lipinski's descriptors are used in the project which considers molecular weight,
    LogP, number of hydrogen bond donors, and number of hydrogen bond acceptors. These
    descriptors are related to the pharmacokinetic properties of molecules.

    The exploratory data analysis was performed via Lipinski's descriptors. Simple
    box plots and scatter plots were plotted to discern differences between the active
    and inactive sets of compounds.

    Mann-Whitney U test was performed for each descriptor to determine the statistically
    significant difference between active and inactive molecules."

    data collection for SIAgroBD. While we are committed to open practices at CONABIO
    and all collected data are open, some external contributors lack the skills to
    use these data, even if they have helped collect them, and are not familiar with
    open practices. Thus my project consists in developing training materials (OER)
    for an introductory workshop on open data with a focus on FAIR principles, biodiversity
    standards, effective management strategies, among other skills that encourage
    contributors to become active users of data apart from collectors. The integration
    of social and biological information and the use of Indigenous data are distinctive
    features of agrobiodiversity research in Mexico that will also be addressed. I
    expect this serves as a prototype for advanced training modules that could be
    used by future contributors or other researchers working on agrobiodiversity topics.

    "The project is an open notebook living systematic review of legal\
    \ documents related to postdoctoral scholars and appointments (postdocs). The\
    \ project aims to use the methods of empirical legal scholarship to describe and\
    \ categorize the ways postdoctoral scholars and their appointments have been involved\
    \ in the legal system. Briefly, empirical legal scholarship is a form of qualitative\
    \ or mixed-methods research, often involving content analysis, that uses legal\
    \ documents or decisions as its data source. We are not aware of any other research\
    \ applying this method or data source to the study of postdocs.  In fact, there\
    \ has been little research of any kind on the legal aspects of postdoc appointments.\n\
    \nBuilding on a “file drawer” paper by Jennifer Miller (with Kristina Van Buskirk),\
    \ we frame our project around the question of whether postdocs are employees or\
    \ students. Based on economic theory, we expect the types of cases to reflect\
    \ whether postdocs are employees producing in a labor market or students consuming\
    \ in a services market. \n\nMore information about the project is available on\

    "This work aims to create a Nigerian sentiment corpus, sentiment, and\
    \ hate speech lexicon through manual annotation for three different languages\
    \ (Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba). Our method for the creation of these language resources\
    \ is as follows: \n \n Nigerian Sentiment Corpus: To create the sentiment corpus,\
    \ tweets from major Nigerian news headlines for each of the three languages will\
    \ be crawled from Twitter using an existing Python crawler we developed. Ten thousand\
    \ tweets will be extracted per language via the Twitter API. Thereafter, the tweets\
    \ will be annotated by native annotators for each of the languages. These annotators\
    \ will be hired and trained to perform the annotation. The annotation tasks consist\
    \ of labeling each tweet as either positive, negative or neutral.To mitigate errors\
    \ and bias, each dataset will be annotated by three different annotators. After\
    \ which the project team will compute the kappa agreement between the annotators\n\
    \ \n Nigerian Sentiment Lexicon: In the same way, manual annotation of the tweets\
    \ will be used to create the sentiment lexicon for each of the three languages.\
    \ The sentiment lexicon annotation task involves Identifying sentiment bearing\
    \ words from each tweet and assigning a sentiment score between +1 to +5 (with\
    \ 1 being the most negative sentiment and +5 the most positive sentiment).\n \n\
    \ Nigerian Hate Speech Lexicon: Extreme negative sentiment from the sentiment\
    \ lexicon will be used to develop the hate speech lexicon. \n \n Annotation tool:\
    \ We plan to use a web-based annotation tool, brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012) which\
    \ has been proved to be efficient for this type of task by many researchers. The\
    \ annotators must be native speakers of the language and follow the annotation\
    \ guidelines provided by the project teams. \n \n HausaNLP aims to create more\
    \ language resources that can be used to train models in machine learning."

    In Europe, prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most frequent type of
    cancer in men and the third most lethal. Current clinical practices, often leading
    to overdiagnosis and overtreatment of indolent tumors, suffer from a lack of precision
    calling for advanced AI models to go beyond SoA. The ProCAncer-I project brings
    together 20 partners, including PCa centers of reference, world leaders in AI,
    and innovative SMEs, with the objective to design, develop, and sustain a cloud-based,
    secure European Image Infrastructure with tools and services for data handling.
    The platform hosts the largest collection of PCa multi-parametric (mp)MRI, anonymized
    image data worldwide (>17,000 cases), based on data donorship, in line with EU
    legislation (GDPR). Robust AI models are developed, based on novel ensemble learning
    methodologies, leading to vendor-specific and -neutral AI models for addressing
    8 PCa clinical scenarios. To accelerate the clinical translation of PCa AI models,
    we focus on improving the trust of the solutions with respect to fairness, safety,
    explainability, and reproducibility. A roadmap for AI models certification is
    defined, interacting with regulatory authorities, thus contributing to a European
    regulatory roadmap for validating the effectiveness of AI-based models for clinical
    decision making.
