  bio: Julieta is a PhD candidate on social studies of science & technology, with
    a background in environmental science. Her research asks how open science hardware
    can contribute to democratize science and tech in the ‘global south’ and what
    it means in each context. She co-founded ‘Open Hardware Makers’, a mentorship
    program like OpenLifeSci but for Hardware; she’s part of the Global Open Science
    Hardware (GOSH) community and loves tinkering with hardware and data for community
    science.
