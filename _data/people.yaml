That project was called [Vuela](https://vuela.cc/) and we copied first and then modified an open source drone (Go Open Hardware!) with the help of many usual suspects (like researchers, open science enthusiasts) but also many very unusual suspects like adult immigrants who never went to university. My formal academic background is in humanities and social sciences, so no surprise that issues of governance, power and inequity in knowledge creation and sharing are what motivate me the most.
