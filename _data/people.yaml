  bio: |-
    I am a Lecturer in Language Education at the University of York in the UK, where I study second language processing and acquisition. My research explores what individual cognitive differences can tell us about the mechanisms underlying second language learning, and how these mechanisms interact with the language environment.

    I also work to make research in education and the language sciences open and accessible to all through my work with EROS, IRIS and OASIS.

    IRIS (https://iris-database.org) is a collection of instruments, materials, stimuli, and data coding and analysis tools used for research into second languages, including second and foreign language learning, multilingualism, language education, language use and processing.

    The OASIS initiative (https://oasis-database.org) is establishing a systematic and sustainable culture of providing open, accessible summaries of research in the language sciences.

    EROS (https://osf.io/qwurf/) is an Open Research working group within the Department of Education at York who advocate for more inclusive, open and reproducible research.

    on molecular mechanisms used by fungi. We collect and analyze genome-scale datasets
    to understand how fungi dynamically reorganize their RNA and protein to adapt
    to environmental change. We also produce open-science software tools, including
    tidyqpcr for quantitative PCR analysis in the tidyverse, and riboviz for ribosome
    profiling analysis. Both of these packages are going through software review and

    a project in collaboration between UCL (my host institution) and University of
    Nottingham to build and maintain a online directory of UK-based tissue samples.
    There I work to develop collaborations with external stakeholders to join-up the
    UK's biomedical research landscape in relation to biobanking - the collection,
    storage and use of (human) biological samples for research. My background is in
    policy development with specific focus on social justice, and patient and public
    engagement in health research and UK clinical guidelines. I have a special interest
    in using creative activities and techniques, such as the use of performance and
    games,  to engage both professionals and the public in research work.
