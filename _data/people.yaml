    I am a Lecturer in Language Education at the University of York in the UK, where I study second language processing and acquisition. My research explores what individual cognitive differences can tell us about the mechanisms underlying second language learning, and how these mechanisms interact with the language environment.

    I also work to make research in education and the language sciences open and accessible to all through my work with EROS, IRIS and OASIS.

    IRIS (https://iris-database.org) is a collection of instruments, materials, stimuli, and data coding and analysis tools used for research into second languages, including second and foreign language learning, multilingualism, language education, language use and processing.

    The OASIS initiative (https://oasis-database.org) is establishing a systematic and sustainable culture of providing open, accessible summaries of research in the language sciences.

  bio: I studied psychology in my undergraduate degree (University of Queensland,
    Australia) and cognitive neuroscience in my postgraduate degree (Queensland Brain
    Institute, Australia). Throughout my PhD, I became increasingly disillusioned
    at the state of academia -- particularly the scholarly publishing system -- and
    decided I would rather devote my career to reforming academia than pursuing my
    research interests (which include consciousness, meditation, attention, and prediction).
    To this end, I joined IGDORE and founded Project Free Our Knowledge, a conditional
    pledge platform that seeks to increase the adoption of open and reproducible research
    practices through collective action.

    to understand how fungi dynamically reorganize their RNA and protein to adapt
    to environmental change. We also produce open-science software tools, including
    tidyqpcr for quantitative PCR analysis in the tidyverse, and riboviz for ribosome
    profiling analysis. Both of these packages are going through software review and
    I'm learning a lot from the process. Alongside my research, I'm an open science
