        type: Mentor-Mentee
        duration: 30 min
        title: Meet your mentor!
        agenda: Meet each other and discuss your personal motivation, expectations, working practices and project goals
        content: |
          This is your first meeting with your OLS mentor. This call should include you and your mentor. If you are working on a team of up to (and no more than) 3 registered participants, you can all meet together with your mentor.

          These 30-minute meetings will happen every other week during OLS. The default time is during your cohort call time. Your mentor will reach out to you this week to confirm when and where you'll be meeting.

          In your first meeting with your mentor, introduce yourselves and then:
          - Make sure you have your GitHub account set up
          - Review your self-assessment
          - Set 1-2 personal open science goals for yourself
          - Set 1-2 open culture goals for your community, organization, or project

          Document your goals in your shared notes; you will return to these goals frequently to assess your progress towards meeting them.
        before: |
          - Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)
          - Complete **your own copy** of the [open leadership self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQgdfj4lPnypAyb9_Ba0Zt7E8J5L6qMvuKwu0wgQsjs/edit?usp=sharing) and share it with your mentor

              If you're a group, each teammate should complete this assessment individually. This is here to help you set your own personal goals during the program. No need to share your results, but be ready to share your thoughts with your mentor.

          - Make sure you know when and how you'll be meeting with your mentor
        after: |
          - Create an issue on the [OLS-2 GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-2/issues/new) for your OLS work and share the link with your mentor
          - Draft a brief vision statement using your goals

              [This lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/introduction-to-open-leadership/stating-your-project-vision/) from the Open Leadership Training Series (OLTS) might be helpful

              You might address:
              - The problem you're trying to solve.
              - How you think openness and open leadership will help solve it.
              - How meeting your personal goals will help you and help solve the problem.
              - How meeting your cultural goals for your community, organization, or project will help solve the problem.

          - Add your vision statement to your GitHub issue
          - Check the [Syllabus](/ols-2) for notes and connection info for all the cohort calls

          - Personal Ecology and self care

            Think about how you might briefly answer the following questions
            - Imagine your most fulfilling day at work. Think of 3 word-pairs to describe it.
            - Imagine your most Unfulfilling day at work. Think of 3 word-pairs to describe it.

            The big idea: identify the most fulfilling conditions under which you thrive - sustain them; identify the least fulfilling conditions that frustrate you - avoid them.

          - Preparing for the Ally Skills

            Think how people step up for you in social scenarios and how you step up for them to support each othe:
            - What do your colleagues do to make your workplace inclusive for you?
            - What do you do to make your workplace inclusive for them?

            The big idea: Based on your experience, what would you consider doing to make your project inclusive for your contributors or team members?

          - how did you choose your career ?
          - what did you study to prepare ?
          - what do you actually do at work on a typical day ?
          - have you ever felt discriminated against (e.g. due to gender, race, ethnicity...) and how did you respond ?
          - do you have a life outside your work ? a family ? hobbies ?
          - what advice would you give someone wanting to enter your field ?
          - on a scale of 1-10 (10 being the most), how much do you enjoy your current work?
          - do you want to switch your career or field? Why or why not?
