# About

**Get ready for an exciting new series of cohorts on open science in collaboration with [NASA-TOPS](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/).**

Funded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), OLS will offer 6-week-long virtual cohorts — Nebula — not just once, but five times each year over the next three years.

We will bring our cohort-based approach, incorporating hands-on learning and individual coaching throughout the training.

Register your interest as a [participant](https://forms.gle/bUEXdcSkt9BgY4tXA), [expert or facilitator](https://forms.gle/DcostkBpszXT9MAr8).

# Program overview

The Nebula program (Open Science 101) is a comprehensive 6-week training program designed for participants at any career stage. The program integrates practical training with individual coaching, supporting participants to apply open science principles, skills, and tools in their work.

# Who is this training for?

This training is aimed at researchers, research-supporting staff, and people who want to integrate best practices for open and reproducible research in new or ongoing projects. Our program is accessible to participants at any career level, from undergraduates to senior scientists, fostering an inclusive environment for those taking their first steps in open science. It will be of particular interest to **individuals or teams** seeking to develop or improve an Open Science strategy or Data Management plan for their research work, whether it is in the proposal stage or already prepared to disseminate results.

Ideas for short projects to work during the program include:
* Sketch an **open science strategy** for a research proposal.
* Develop a **data management plan** that balances open access with privacy requirements.
* Conduct a **reproducibility check** on a section of your research data or code.
* Outline a plan for **making your research findings more inclusive** for diverse audiences. 

# Training format and content

Our cohorts provide structured training covering the [Open Science 101 Curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/). Each week, we explore one open science module, with expert speakers from diverse scientific domains guiding hands-on learning. Sessions feature practical assignments, empowering learners to actively **implement open science concepts and tools in their work**. 

Synchronous training sessions take place on Zoom, twice a week. The sessions are delivered in English with automatic live captions. Recordings are openly accessible after the calls. The program also provides opportunities to connect with fellow participants. 

Individual participants or teams meet with an expert for **weekly coaching sessions to receive personalized feedback** on their project.

Upon graduation, participants receive a digital badge certifying their completion of NASA’s Open Science 101 curriculum and an OLS certificate. The expected time commitment for this training is 4-4.5 hrs per week. 


The schedule for individual cohorts is shown below:
