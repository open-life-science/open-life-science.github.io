# Course description

This leadership course is possibly the first in the world to provide an **intersectional framework** that underpins a leadership course for those working as RSEs and those in the tech industry.

It is also unique in that we meet with you first to understand what challenges you are facing and to to create an individual development plan just for you.

We will then craft a practical training course just for you and a small group of other leaders to ensure all your needs are being met as an individual and as a group.

# Topics

The course will cover
* Using a Diversity and Inclusion framework to improve your team.
* Using Continuous Improvement skills to identify talent.
* Setup and maintain pipelines to attract talent.
* Project Management in complex scenarios.
* Managing high-performance teams.
* How to deal with difficult change management situations and build relationships.

# Sessions

- **Dates**: from **17th of October** to **28th of November
- **Frequency**: weekly, on Tuesdays or Fridays, based on participant availability
- **Duration**: around two and a half hours

# Pricing

* **£499 GBP** for initial skills consult and personal development plan.
* **£1999 GBP** for a series of workshops with a small number of other leaders, that is crafted to your needs based on the initial consultation.
