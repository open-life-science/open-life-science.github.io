      [Open Seeds](/openseeds/) is a **16-week** **mentoring** and **training** program for people interested in applying **open principles** in their work and becoming **Open Science ambassadors** in their communities.

      OLS runs Open Seeds since early 2020 with 2 cohorts per year. 380+ people participating in 260+ projects were taught with the support of 130+ mentors, 170+ experts, and 30+ facilitators.

      Funded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), this work aims to deliver fully virtual training cohorts for the [NASA TOPS OpenCore training curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) with a highly qualitative component throughout the training. 
      
      Starting in 2024 and for 3 years, the team will deliver five 6-week Virtual Cohorts per year. The cohorts will include guided reflection and hands-on implementation of open science concepts, processes, and techniques. This program will teach one OpenCore Module per week, by bringing in expert speakers from across different scientific domains, allowing learners to actively embed their training in their work and reflect on their learning with a mentor.

      You can read more about it in the [proposal](https://zenodo.org/records/8250979).
