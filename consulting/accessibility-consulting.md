## Scientific video captioning and live streaming / accessibility consulting.

OLS has a long history of captioning videos as part of running online inclusive calls. Currently, we offer scientific video preparation and captioning, including: 

- Transcript preparation and correction (mixture of online automatic captioning, with human corrections for quality control and accent/scientific terminology correction). 
- Upload and segmentation. 
- Live stream advice for multilingual and hearing-accessible calls

Sample work: [youtube.com/openlifesci]({{ site.youtube }})

Rates start at $75USD / hour for video captioning.
