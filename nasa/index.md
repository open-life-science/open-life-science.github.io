Funded by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/), this work aims to deliver fully virtual training cohorts for the [NASA TOPS OpenCore training curriculum](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/) with a 
highly qualitative component throughout the training. 

# About
      
Starting in 2024 and for 3 years, the team will deliver five 6-week Virtual Cohorts per year. The cohorts will include guided reflection and hands-on implementation of open science concepts, processes, and 
techniques. This program will teach one OpenCore Module per week, by bringing in expert speakers from across different scientific domains, allowing learners to actively embed their training in their work and 
reflect on their learning with a mentor.
