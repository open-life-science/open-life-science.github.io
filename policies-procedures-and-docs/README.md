# policies-procedures-and-docs
Public-facing policies, procedures, and documentation around running the OLS program, such that others can benefit and re-use the policies if running similar programs. 

Note that certain documentation (such as passwords and authentication credentials) and internal OLS business processes that could be deemed private or business-specific (e.g. how payroll is processed) should not be uploaded into this repository.
