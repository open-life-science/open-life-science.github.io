The **Catalyst** program by OLS is for people interested in **applying open principles** in their work and **becoming Open Science ambassadors** in their communities.

# About

This is a **16-week long personal mentorship and cohort-based training**, where participants (organisers, hosts, mentors and project leads/mentees) of this program will:
- **share** their expertise and gain knowledge essential to create, lead, and sustain an Open Science project
- **connect** with members across different projects, communities, backgrounds, and identities
- **empower** each other to become effective Open Science ambassadors in their communities

Participants join this program with a **project** that they either are already working on or want to develop during this program **individually or in teams**.

## Timeline

The first cohort (CAT-1) runs from **August 26th to December 9th, 2024**. 
For more information, see the [Catalyst website](https://catalystproject.cloud/).
