@article{hall_ten_2024,
 abstract = {Inclusion at academic events is facing increased scrutiny as the communities these events serve raise their expectations for who can practically attend. Active efforts in recent years to bring more diversity to academic events have brought progress and created momentum. However, we must reflect on these efforts and determine which underrepresented groups are being disadvantaged. Inclusion at academic events is important to ensure diversity of discourse and opinion, to help build networks, and to avoid academic siloing. All of these contribute to the development of a robust and resilient academic field. We have developed these Ten Simple Rules both to amplify the voices that have been speaking out and to celebrate the progress of many Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity practices that continue to drive the organisation of academic events. The Rules aim to raise awareness as well as provide actionable suggestions and tools to support these initiatives further. This aims to support academic organisations such as the Deep Learning Indaba, Neuromatch Academy, the IBRO-Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo, Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), Arabs in Neuroscience, FAIRPoints, and OLS (formerly Open Life Science). This article is a call to action for organisers to reevaluate the impact and reach of their inclusive practices.},

@article{treasure_ten_2022,
 abstract = {In recent years, a wide variety of mentorship programmes targeting issues that cannot be addressed through traditional teaching and learning methods alone have been developed. Mentoring plays significant roles in the growth and development of both mentors and mentees, and the positive impacts of mentoring have been well documented. Mentorship programmes are therefore increasingly being implemented in a wide variety of fields by organisations, academic institutes, businesses, and governments. While there is a growing body of literature on mentoring and mentorship programmes, gaining a clear overview of the field is often challenging. In this article, we therefore provide a concise summary of recommendations to consider when designing and establishing mentorship programmes. These recommendations are based on the collective knowledge and experiences of 4 different emerging and established mentorship programmes and can be adapted across various mentorship settings or contexts.},

@article{williams_international_2023,
 abstract = {Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields change rapidly and are increasingly interdisciplinary. Commonly, STEMM practitioners use short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short courses for upskilling and reskilling, but unaddressed challenges limit SFT’s effectiveness and inclusiveness. Education researchers, students in SFT courses, and organizations have called for research and strategies that can strengthen SFT in terms of effectiveness, inclusiveness, and accessibility across multiple dimensions. This paper describes the project that resulted in a consensus set of 14 actionable recommendations to systematically strengthen SFT. A diverse international group of 30 experts in education, accessibility, and life sciences came together from 10 countries to develop recommendations that can help strengthen SFT globally. Participants, including representation from some of the largest life science training programs globally, assembled findings in the educational sciences and encompassed the experiences of several of the largest life science SFT programs. The 14 recommendations were derived through a Delphi method, where consensus was achieved in real time as the group completed a series of meetings and tasks designed to elicit specific recommendations. Recommendations cover the breadth of SFT contexts and stakeholder groups and include actions for instructors (e.g., make equity and inclusion an ethical obligation), programs (e.g., centralize infrastructure for assessment and evaluation), as well as organizations and funders (e.g., professionalize training SFT instructors; deploy SFT to counter inequity). Recommendations are aligned with a purpose-built framework—“The Bicycle Principles”—that prioritizes evidenced-based teaching, inclusiveness, and equity, as well as the ability to scale, share, and sustain SFT. We also describe how the Bicycle Principles and recommendations are consistent with educational change theories and can overcome systemic barriers to delivering consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT.},

@article{yehudi_research_2025,
 abstract = {Research software is usually developed by researchers themselves or by software developers working closely with researchers. It is typically developed to meet specific research needs. We develop and evaluate a comprehensive and flexible software lifecycle framework that reflects the unique challenges of research software. In review of related work on commercial and open-source software lifecycles, we observed limitations in addressing the heterogeneous, irregular development patterns, and longitudinal and cyclical nature of many research software projects. An initial model, which was based on case-study research of thirty-eight open-source projects was refined through collaborative discussion at a Dagstuhl seminar, introducing additional state transitions, and expanding details on blocked and active development stages for the specific context of research software. We highlight the overlap and extensions in the new model compared to prior literature and present the evaluation with the research software community. We derive the research software stages from our lifecycle model to categorise research software accordingly.},

@article{yehudi_subjective_2023,
 abstract = {Biological science produces “big data” in varied formats, which necessitates using computational tools to process, integrate, and analyse data. Researchers using computational biology tools range from those using computers for communication, to those writing analysis code. We examine differences in how researchers conceptualise the same data, which we call “subjective data models”. We interviewed 22 people with biological experience and varied levels of computational experience, and found that many had fluid subjective data models that changed depending on circumstance. Surprisingly, results did not cluster around participants’ computational experience levels. People did not consistently map entities from abstract data models to the real-world entities in files, and certain data identifier formats were easier to infer meaning from than others. Real-world implications: 1) software engineers should design interfaces for task performance, emulating popular user interfaces, rather than targeting professional backgrounds; 2) when insufficient context is provided, people may guess what data means, whether or not they are correct, emphasising the importance of contextual metadata to remove the need for erroneous guesswork.},
