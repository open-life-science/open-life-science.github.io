# Core team

<!--As the graduates, mentors, and hosts of various Mozilla Open Leaders cohorts, we have gained expertise in the technical and culture track. Furthermore, we participate in a wide range of activities in different international communities of practice in the sciences: ELIXIR (European bioinformatics network), Galaxy, The Carpentries, Software Sustainability Institute (SSI), Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), and Mozilla.-->
