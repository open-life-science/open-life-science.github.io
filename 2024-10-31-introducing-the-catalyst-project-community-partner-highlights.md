The **[Catalyst Project](https://catalystproject.cloud/)** is a community-engaged initiative designed to support the adoption of open science principles in **under-served bioscientific research communities** through the provision of reliable and sustainable cloud computing infrastructure. It’s a project we’ve been working on now for almost two years, which involves staff from seven different organizations: [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/about/), [CCAD](https://ccad.unc.edu.ar/), [CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/), [IOI](http://investinopen.org/), [MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/), and [OLS]({{ site.url }}), and is funded by the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).

A key part of the project is engaging with **Community Partners in Africa and Latin America**: Institutions, organizations, and individuals who are undertaking bioscientific research projects that require **cloud computing infrastructure**. As collaborators on the Catalyst Project, Community Partners can access and use 2i2c’s open science cloud services, and also receive training from 2i2c, The Carpentries, MetaDocencia, and OLS to support their work. Community Partners also play a vital role in shaping an evolving governance model for the Catalyst Project to help sustain, scale, and maximize impact in Latin America, Africa, and under-served communities around the world.

In a new collection of blog posts (that we hope will expand over the next couple of months!), we’re highlighting the work of the Catalyst Project Community Partners. This post is a gateway to learning more about the Catalyst Project and its Community Partners. If you have any questions or feedback about the project, please send an [email to the core team](mailto:catalyst-project-core-team@googlegroups.com).

# Highlighting the Catalyst Project Community Partners
The Catalyst Project currently involves **19 Community Partners**, **9 in Africa** and **10 in Latin America**. Our initial blog post series showcases seven of the Partners, and each post is available in English and Spanish:

## About these blog posts - acknowledgements
Creating a series of blog posts to highlight the work of the Catalyst Community Partners was a collaborative effort involving staff from CSCCE, 2i2c, OLS, and MetaDocencia. Specifically, **Lou Woodley, Katie Pratt, Jenny Wong, and Tajuddeen Gwadabe** conceived the idea during our regular Catalyst Project “website team” meetings, and developed a strategy for reaching out to community partners to gather information. 

Katie then led that outreach, which involved a representative of each Community Partners completing a Google Form to answer three key questions and sharing a photo (or a selection of photos) to use on the blog. Katie curated all of the information, edited together the blog posts, and secured sign-off from all of the partners. **Sabrina López** coordinated the translation of the posts from English to Spanish, and Jenny formatted and published them on the website.

We’re grateful to the Community Partners for generously sharing more about their work - and we look forward to highlighting more Catalyst Project Community Partners soon!
