## The Branding Journey
In a bid to expand our reach and uphold our commitment to diversity, OLS embarked on a journey to expand its brand identity. From this, emerged a **new logo and name** for the mentoring program - _Open Seeds_. If you're interested in the story behind these changes, read all about **our rebranding adventure** in this insightful [blog post]({% link _posts/2023-04-18-Introducing-the-new-OLS.md %}). It takes you through the decision-making process, creative inspiration, and the vision that led to our new identity.

## Brand Assets
Various versions of our logos, all carefully crafted to reflect the values and spirit of our community, can be found in the [branding GitHub repository]({{ site.github.owner_url }}/branding).
