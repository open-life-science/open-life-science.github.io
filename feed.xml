        <title>Reflections on the DRI Journey: Advancing TBI Care in Indigenous Communities.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This speedblog, written by &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#damario99&quot;&gt;Sebastian D’Amario&lt;/a&gt;, is part of the OLS-9 cohort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-background&quot;&gt;Project Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivation for this project stems from a deep commitment to addressing healthcare disparities, particularly in Indigenous communities. As a PhD student in &lt;strong&gt;Neuroscience at Queen’s University, Canada&lt;/strong&gt;, I am passionate about leveraging digital research infrastructure (DRI) to improve access to traumatic brain injury (TBI) care in remote areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of specialized medical resources for head injuries in these communities inspired me to develop an advanced TBI screening tool that can be used in rural and remote environments. This project is not just about technology; it’s about empowering communities and ensuring equitable access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expectations-from-this-program&quot;&gt;Expectations from this Program&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I joined the DRI equity, diversity, inclusion, and accessibility (EDIA) Champions program, I hoped to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain a deeper understanding of best practices while integrating DRI tools into my research.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn how to effectively engage with equity-seeking groups, particularly Indigenous communities, to ensure that the tools we develop are culturally appropriate and beneficial to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program offered a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between advanced technology and its practical application in underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-set-at-the-beginning-of-the-project&quot;&gt;Goals Set at the Beginning of the Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the outset, my primary goals were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To develop a culturally sensitive TBI screening tool for remote Indigenous communities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To build DRI capacity within Indigenous communities by training local healthcare providers in using these tools.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To ensure that the project adheres to Indigenous data sovereignty principles, with community involvement at every stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-understanding-and-accomplishments&quot;&gt;Key Understanding and Accomplishments&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the program, I’ve learned and accomplished several key things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cultural-sensitivity-in-technology&quot;&gt;Cultural Sensitivity in Technology&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how to design technology that respects and incorporates Indigenous cultural practices. This has been crucial in ensuring that the tools we develop are effective and culturally appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dri-integration&quot;&gt;DRI Integration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These technologies hold great potential to streamline data management and improve diagnostic capabilities, particularly in remote settings where timely and accurate assessments are critical. Work thus far has significantly improved the efficiency of our TBI screening tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;community-engagement&quot;&gt;Community Engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve established strong partnerships with Indigenous communities and am continuously ensuring that the project is co-developed and approved by those whom it aims to serve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-main-goals-achieved-in-this-project&quot;&gt;The Main Goals Achieved in this Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goals I set at the beginning of the project have largely been achieved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve developed a TBI screening tool that is now being tested in remote Indigenous communities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The integration of DRI tools has been successful, and we’ve begun training local healthcare providers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The project has also been co-developed with Indigenous communities, ensuring that it adheres to Indigenous data sovereignty principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My immediate next step is to finalize training for the TBI screening tool for all rural healthcare workers involved and continue ramping up its rollout in select Indigenous communities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, I aim to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Expand the tool’s use across more remote communities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue building local capacity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Advocate for policy changes to integrate DRI tools into routine healthcare practices in underserved areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to stay connected with the OLS community and other members. I believe that ongoing collaboration and knowledge sharing are essential for the success of projects like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;special-mentions-and-acknowledgements&quot;&gt;Special Mentions and Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknowledge the invaluable support of my mentor, Dr. Douglas James Cook. I also want to thank the Indigenous communities I’ve had the pleasure to be involved with, particularly the &lt;strong&gt;Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation, Weeneebayko Health Authority, and Marten Falls First Nations&lt;/strong&gt;, for their collaboration and trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I’d like to acknowledge the &lt;strong&gt;DRI EDIA Champions program&lt;/strong&gt; for providing the resources and support needed to bring this project to life. This project has been a transformative journey, and I am excited to see where it will continue to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The FOSDEM 2025 Experience</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me start by saying that &lt;strong&gt;this trip almost didn’t happen&lt;/strong&gt;. A visa application I started in early November was still unresolved a day before FOSDEM. Without my passport, I had to cancel my flight. But with just a few hours to go, something changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 30th, I received a notification that my passport had reached Abuja, and DHL would take at least 24 hours to get it to Port Harcourt. Long story short? I wrote a letter authorising a friend in Abuja to pick up the passport and check the visa approval status. The outcome was positive! The next morning (January 31st), I was on the first flight to Abuja. After a first flight, a long layover and a second flight, I finally reached Brussels on Saturday morning — just in time to rush straight to FOSDEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amidst all this chaos, I missed the first conference I had planned to attend before FOSDEM — CHAOSScon25.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-time-fosdem-experience&quot;&gt;First-Time FOSDEM Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first time attending FOSDEM in person. Last year, I had only given a talk online — my first international talk. 
Being there in person this year was an awesome experience, and I can’t thank OLS enough for making it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organiser&quot;&gt;Organiser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting long-time organisers of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://research-fosdem.github.io/&quot;&gt;Open Research Devroom&lt;/a&gt; was a learning experience. I was exposed to the challenges of scheduling online talks across different time zones and learned how to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pretalx.com/p/about/&quot;&gt;Pretalx&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing abstracts and proposals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Kzylq99OMN7J1pAfVu6urg.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A small classroom, with attendees sitting in rows of chairs, forming an &amp;quot;n&amp;quot; shape. In front of the room is a group of ten (10) people from varying nationalities and gender groups. They are the members of the organising committee of the conference. Behind them is a blank projector screen, and in front, a beige table.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 85%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my small but exciting contributions was adding the schedule to the website and enhancing it with a little CSS for better aesthetics and UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got to experience the subtle power of keeping speakers on schedule — holding up signs to let them know they had “x minutes left.” So much power!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speaker&quot;&gt;Speaker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5199-research-101-promoting-diversity-through-open-science-literacy/&quot;&gt;lightning talk on Pre-seeds&lt;/a&gt;, sharing early insights from our ongoing survey on underrepresented groups in research. 
We have a small team working on this, with a roadmap in place and a survey aimed at understanding what people want in a course like Pre-seeds. This was a great opportunity to showcase our progress and gather feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*vqSSuDnOMUtDBjY9fpoEQw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A conference room, with a speaker, Debs, delivering a talk. Debs is an African woman of average height and dark hair. She is wearing a blue &amp;quot;FOSDEM Organisers&amp;quot; t-shirt over her black long-sleeved sweater, and is pointing at the projected slide. The current slide is a blue page with a title in white text, which reads - &amp;quot;JOIN OUR TEAM&amp;quot; - with 5 members of an all-female team in display.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 85%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;attendee&quot;&gt;Attendee&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1-open-research-devroom&quot;&gt;Day 1: Open Research Devroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the standout talks were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Applying the ‘Do No Harm’ Principle to Open Source Practices and Technology”&lt;/strong&gt; —&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk drew inspiration from the Hippocratic Oath, where doctors swear to do no harm. It made me reflect on how, while we can’t prevent all harm in open source, we should strive to minimise intentional and avoidable harm. Dr. Malvika Sharan discussed how openness — our invitation for people to use, remix, and build on our work — can sometimes perpetuate harm. This thought-provoking session initiated deeper discussions about the ethical aspects of open science and responsible research practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QMdTl1zvQ6_9U3bMq-p0Dw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A conference room photographed from the left side of the room, showing a speaker, and some members of the audience. The speaker, Malvika, is an Indian woman of small stature and silky dark hair, wearing a white long-sleeved shirt under a sleeveless maroon dress. She is presenting from a slide that reads &amp;quot;The Do No Harm Project.&amp;quot;&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 85%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JOSSCast: Experimenting with Storytelling in Open Research&lt;/strong&gt; —&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abigail Cabunoc Mayes and Arfon Smith spoke about their experiment with JOSSCast, a podcast designed to connect researchers, developers, and contributors through storytelling. 
They shared insights into what worked, what didn’t, and how podcasts can strengthen open research by engaging both technical and non-technical audiences. This session reinforced the power of storytelling in science communication and community-building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-2-funders-devroom&quot;&gt;Day 2: Funders Devroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlights of my day were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Storytelling, Networking, and Strategy: Three Keys to Successful Fundraising”&lt;/strong&gt; by Amy Parker.
This was easily my favorite session of the day. She broke down fundraising success into three key components: “the right ask (&lt;strong&gt;Storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;) to the right person (&lt;strong&gt;Networking&lt;/strong&gt;) at the right time (&lt;strong&gt;Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;).”
It was a brilliant talk on how to align these elements to secure funding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pMs2GAQEaVw4HFLn_7zHuA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image shows a speaker, Amy Parker, in front of a well-lit classroom, presenting on &amp;quot;Three Keys to Successful Fundraising.&amp;quot; Amy is a white woman with dark hair, wearing an OpenSSL sweater and a bright smile. The slide projected behind her is titled &amp;quot;Networking&amp;quot; and shares on the importance of building connections and relationships.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 85%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funders Devroom organisers AMA Session&lt;/strong&gt;
I was looking forward to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#emmyft&quot;&gt;Emmy Tsang&lt;/a&gt;’s talk on “Funding the FOSS Ecosystem”&lt;/strong&gt;, but unfortunately, it was canceled due to her Eurostar delay. That was heartbreaking. However, the Devroom organisers salvaged the situation with an impromptu Ask Me Anything (AMA) session.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Small Seeds — Why Funding New Ideas Matters”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk by by Marie Kreil and Marie-Lena Wiese (of &lt;a href=&quot;https://prototypefund.de/en/&quot;&gt;Prototype Fund&lt;/a&gt;) struck a personal chord. They emphasised the importance of supporting young and novel ideas, which resonated with me as I work on &lt;a href=&quot;https://npdebs.github.io/Pre-seeds-Program/&quot;&gt;Pre-seeds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“When is it Right to Say No to Funding?”&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/karensandler/&quot;&gt;Karen Sandler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a surprising but essential session. In a room with people trying to secure funding, this talk took a different approach — outlining cases where declining funding is the better choice, such as misaligned values, unreasonable workloads, or funders attempting to rewrite the purpose of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-fosdem-maze&quot;&gt;The FOSDEM Maze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sheer size of FOSDEM was overwhelming&lt;/strong&gt; — multiple buildings, endless rooms, and long queues outside popular Devrooms. Trying to navigate was a bit daunting for a first timer, and I imagine this might be the case even for people who are already familiar with how FOSDEM works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of the best things about FOSDEM is that all &lt;strong&gt;talks are recorded&lt;/strong&gt;. So, when the chaos becomes too much, you can take a break, grab some waffles, and catch up later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I can’t not mention ‘&lt;strong&gt;sticker heaven&lt;/strong&gt;’ — There was an entire section dedicated to stickers, and I wanted one (or six) of everything. I need more laptops to put these on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-friendships&quot;&gt;The Friendships&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of FOSDEM was reconnecting with friends and meeting new people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My friend and &lt;strong&gt;SSI brother, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidperezsuarez/&quot;&gt;David Luiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, gave me the most amazing hug — thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#sapetti9&quot;&gt;Sara Petti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and I snuck into the Funders Devroom, sat through talks, and chatted about life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#malvikasharan&quot;&gt;Malvika Sharan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; treated me to lunch on both days, unaware of how much that “small” gesture meant to me. Thank you for the book!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KVuYrgvglu346wGSjyVVYA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A woman wearing jeans and a black winter jacket sits on a metal chair, with her right leg crossed over the left. An open book is placed on her leg, and she is writing a note on the second preliminary page of the book, with a black pen.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 85%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting the Open Research Devroom team&lt;/strong&gt; in person was great too, as they were all welcoming and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I finally got to chat with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ruth-ikegah&quot;&gt;Ruth Ikegah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, someone I’ve admired from afar for her efforts to represent Africa in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The GitHub Maintainers Afterparty was another highlight — I hung out with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/duncan--hall/&quot;&gt;Duncan Hall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and met &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthcheesley/&quot;&gt;Ruth Cheesley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, whose calm demeanor was exactly what I needed after two intense days of FOSDEM-ing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;finally&quot;&gt;Finally…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regret not being able to attend &lt;a href=&quot;https://chaoss.community/sn/chaosscon-2025-eu/&quot;&gt;CHAOSSCon25&lt;/a&gt;, but will try extra hard to be there come 2026 — even though that outcome is not mine to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also can’t attend the German RSE Conference (25–27th) to present my poster because my visa is only valid until the 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges of getting to FOSDEM’25, it was worth every moment. From speaking and organising to attending brilliant sessions and making meaningful connections, this experience will stay with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time, Brussels! 🧇🇧🇪&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Leveraging Digital Research Infrastructure for Environmental DNA Tools in Monitoring Indigenous Territories.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This speedblog, written by &lt;a href=&quot;https://marklouielopez.weebly.com/&quot;&gt;Mark Louie Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, is part of the OLS-9 cohort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a freshwater biologist and molecular ecologist, my work has always centered on advancing environmental monitoring and conservation science. 
Over the years, I have had the privilege of contributing to this field through research outputs, collaborations, and community engagement. 
One of the most exciting projects I am currently involved in is the development of environmental DNA (eDNA) tools for biodiversity monitoring in Indigenous lands, supported by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alliancecan.ca/en/initiatives/dri-investments&quot;&gt;Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s DRI EDIA pilot program&lt;/a&gt;. 
This project is not only a scientific endeavor but also a collaborative effort to empower Indigenous communities and address pressing environmental challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025-02-louie-blog-photos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo collage containing four (4) related images, showing members of the Chipewyan Prairie First Nation in Northeastern Alberta, as they collect freshwater fish from Lake Winnefred. In the top left square of the collage, men lined up in a row pull on a fish-filled net. In the top right square, a man stands on ice, overlooking many fish. The bottom left image is of a row of fish on the frozen out lake and on the bottom right is an image of three (3) men tugging on the net.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 80%; max-height: 600px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-project&quot;&gt;The Project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging Science and Indigenous Knowledge: The project, titled &lt;em&gt;“Utilizing Digital Research Infrastructure (DRI) to Develop Environmental DNA Tools for Biodiversity Monitoring in Indigenous Lands,”&lt;/em&gt; focuses on creating cutting-edge eDNA tools to monitor priority species in collaboration with Indigenous partners. 
These tools are part of the broader &lt;a href=&quot;https://itrackdna.ca/&quot;&gt;iTrackDNA program&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to integrate eDNA technology with Indigenous Knowledge to enhance biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Environmental DNA (eDNA)—genetic material shed by organisms into their environment—offers a non-invasive, cost-effective, and highly accurate method for detecting species. 
By analyzing eDNA, we can monitor biodiversity without disturbing ecosystems, making it an invaluable tool for conservation. However, developing robust eDNA tools requires advanced computational resources to process large genomic datasets. 
This is where the &lt;a href=&quot;https://alliancecan.ca/en&quot;&gt;Digital Research Alliance of Canada&lt;/a&gt; plays a pivotal role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-role-of-digital-research-infrastructure&quot;&gt;The Role of Digital Research Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of eDNA tools involves several computational steps, including the assembly of mitochondrial genomes, identification of unique genetic sequences for primer design, and statistical modeling to validate assay sensitivity. 
These tasks demand high-performance computing resources, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Cedar&quot;&gt;Cedar cluster&lt;/a&gt;, which the Digital Research Alliance provides. Access to these resources enables us to process vast amounts of genomic data efficiently, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of our eDNA tools.
​
To fully leverage these resources, I have identified key training needs, including preparing submission scripts, debugging parallel computation jobs, and monitoring multiple tasks concurrently. 
These skills are essential for maximizing the potential of DRI in advancing our research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;collaboration-with-indigenous-communities&quot;&gt;Collaboration with Indigenous Communities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cornerstone of this project is its collaborative approach with Indigenous partners. By integrating traditional ecological knowledge with eDNA technology, we aim to create a comprehensive understanding of ecosystem dynamics. 
This not only validates Indigenous Knowledge but also empowers communities to take an active role in managing their natural resources.
Adhering to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/&quot;&gt;OCAP principles (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession)&lt;/a&gt;, we ensure that all data collected within Indigenous territories remains under the control of the Indigenous communities. 
This commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty is fundamental to our work, fostering trust and equitable partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;addressing-barriers-for-equity-seeking-groups&quot;&gt;Addressing Barriers for Equity-Seeking Groups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the &lt;strong&gt;2SLGBTQQIA+ community&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;racialized immigrant&lt;/strong&gt;, I am deeply aware of the barriers faced by equity-seeking groups in accessing advanced research infrastructure. 
These barriers include limited awareness of available resources, insufficient training opportunities, and a lack of institutional support. 
By providing training and resources, this project aims to empower underrepresented researchers and Indigenous communities, fostering a more inclusive and diverse scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Co-design biodiversity monitoring projects&lt;/strong&gt; with Indigenous partners, identifying priority species for eDNA assay development.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct online training sessions&lt;/strong&gt; on using DRI for eDNA assay design, targeting equity-seeking researchers and Indigenous scientific staff.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate targeted eDNA assays&lt;/strong&gt; and apply them to monitor biodiversity in Indigenous lands, providing timely and accurate data to our partners.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch a social media campaign&lt;/strong&gt; to raise awareness about the role of DRI in advancing eDNA research and supporting equity-seeking groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We anticipate engaging over 100 individuals from equity-seeking groups, including Indigenous communities, racialized researchers, and first-generation post-secondary students. 
By measuring the impact of these activities, we aim to demonstrate how DRI can drive innovation and inclusivity in environmental research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ols-open-seeds-mentoring-program&quot;&gt;The OLS “Open Seeds” Mentoring Program&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds/&quot;&gt;Open Seeds program&lt;/a&gt; is a 16-week personal mentorship and cohort-based training designed to empower individuals to become Open Science ambassadors in their communities. As part of the OLS-9 cohort, I have had the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Share expertise and gain knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; essential for creating, leading, and sustaining Open Science projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connect with a diverse network&lt;/strong&gt; of mentors, experts, and peers from various backgrounds and identities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Develop leadership skills&lt;/strong&gt; to effectively advocate for Open Science principles and practices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OLS program has been instrumental in helping me refine my project’s goals, enhance my understanding of Open Science, and build a strong foundation for collaboration with Indigenous partners. 
The mentorship and skill-building sessions, such as the &lt;strong&gt;GitHub tutorial for beginners&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Open Leadership: Academia, industry, and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;, have equipped me with the tools needed to navigate the complexities of open and collaborative research.
​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-vision-for-the-future&quot;&gt;A Vision for the Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project represents a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between advanced scientific tools and Indigenous Knowledge, fostering a collaborative approach to biodiversity monitoring. 
By leveraging the Digital Research Alliance’s infrastructure and the mentorship provided by the OLS program, we can develop robust eDNA tools that empower Indigenous communities, inform conservation strategies, and contribute to the sustainable management of Canada’s natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move forward, I am excited to see how this initiative will not only advance scientific research but also create a more inclusive and equitable research ecosystem. 
Together, we can harness the power of technology and traditional knowledge to protect our planet’s biodiversity for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pressing &quot;pause&quot; on Nebula</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a NASA grantee, OLS has been running the 6-week Nebula training program since early 2024. With the new USA government, we have been asked to pause our open science 101 training for the next few months, while the curriculum is reviewed. We’ll let you all know when the training is available again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of OLS’s other open research activities have changed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Translating caribou habitat modelling with indigenous insights</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This speedblog is part of the OLS-9 cohort, where participants explore open science principles while developing their projects. In this post, Melleason shares insights from their work on integrating indigenous knowledge with scientific methods to improve caribou habitat conservation on the Slate Islands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;project-background&quot;&gt;Project Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains the Red List, which categorizes species from “Least Concern” to “Extinct” to highlight conservation priorities. The caribou is listed as “Vulnerable,” raising significant conservation concerns. Within Lake Superior lies the Slate Islands, part of the traditional territory of the Biigtigong First Nation. These islands were once home to a thriving caribou population, which was extirpated from the area a few decades ago. There is an ongoing effort to reintroduce caribou to the Slate Islands, with a small number already introduced. However, two critical challenges persist:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The nature of the habitat, including historical changes and projected changes critical for caribou survival, remains poorly understood.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Current conservation approaches rely heavily on scientific methods, such as remote sensing, limiting inclusiveness and failing to integrate the knowledge of Indigenous communities.
As a result, my project seeks to bridge Indigenous knowledge and scientific understanding, including remote sensing, to develop effective conservation strategies for caribou on the Slate Islands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://github.com/Melleason/Caribou-habitat-management-/raw/1b7966cab9c523b75c4cd236afa5f799a79041ce/data/Images/Caribou_SlateIsland_MosesElleason.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;sub-adult male caribou spotted on the Slate islands on August 2024&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-and-expectations-in-ols&quot;&gt;Goals and Expectations in OLS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the Open Life Science (OLS) program, I aimed to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn methods for engaging diverse communities, including Indigenous peoples, to ensure the success of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Understand best practices in research data management, particularly in contexts emphasizing Indigenous data sovereignty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-achieved-key-insights-and-accomplishments&quot;&gt;Goals Achieved, Key Insights, and Accomplishments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My project has two phases: remote sensing and social science. While awaiting Research Ethics Board (REB) approval to proceed with the second phase (interviews with Indigenous community members), key accomplishments include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completion of field survey of the Slate Islands to validate Landsat data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Development of a current habitat map for the Slate Islands and habitat change map spanning 1984–2024.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Participating in Indigenous festivals to build trust and strengthen relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completed an REB application for interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating project information on my GitHub repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through OLS training, I gained critical skills and insights in areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Management Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Leveraging the “mountain of engagement” framework to lead effectively and foster community involvement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tooling for Open Project Design:&lt;/strong&gt; Utilizing open-source tools to design and communicate projects effectively, enhancing GitHub proficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Management Practices:&lt;/strong&gt; Emphasizing appropriate handling of sensitive data, particularly regarding Indigenous governance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short term, I plan to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conduct interviews to incorporate Indigenous perspectives on forest changes and their impacts on wildlife.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Refine the habitat and habitat change maps by integrating Indigenous definitions and insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, I aim to expand this research to other lake-moderated islands and their Indigenous communities in southern Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;staying-connected&quot;&gt;Staying Connected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to maintaining ties with the OLS community, continuing to learn and contribute to open science. I have subscribed to their social media platforms and remain available for future learning and mentoring opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;acknowledgments&quot;&gt;Acknowledgments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work has been successful thanks to the guidance of my university supervisors, DRI EDIA/OLS instructors, and mentor &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#acocac&quot;&gt;Alejandro Coca-Castro&lt;/a&gt;. I also appreciate the financial support from the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (MECP) and the Digital Research Alliance of Canada (DRAC).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcoming our new OLS Resident Fellow — Sara Villa</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;¡Nos entusiasma darle la bienvenida a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#saravilla&quot;&gt;Sara Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, quien se une al equipo de OLS como Senior Fellow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sara-senior-fellow-en-ols-español&quot;&gt;Sara, Senior Fellow en OLS (Español)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;columns&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column is-3&quot;&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/sara-villa-portrait.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image shows Sara Villa, a woman from Palencia, Spain. She has brown bangs, and is wearing a black tank top, with the strap of a black backpack slung over one shoulder. Sara is posing infront of some mountains in Picos de Europa National Park, with wide eyes and a broad smile!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;column&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Sara es una investigadora cuya pasión por la Ciencia Abierta la ha llevado a ser mentora e instructora en los programas &lt;a href=&quot;/openseeds/&quot;&gt;Open Seeds&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a href=&quot;/nebula/&quot;&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; de OLS. A Sara le interesan la &lt;strong&gt;cultura de investigación en entornos académicos y la construcción de comunidades&lt;/strong&gt;, y aspira a acercar estas habilidades a todas las personas que hacen o apoyan la investigación.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Siguiendo la consigna de The Turing Way sobre hacer la &lt;em&gt;reproducibilidad demasiado fácil como para no hacerla&lt;/em&gt;, Sara aboga por la investigación abierta en todos los niveles. Le encanta presentar y dar capacitaciones (y capacitarse) sobre el tema.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Como Senior Fellow en OLS, Sara &lt;strong&gt;diseñará y adaptará el programa de Open Seeds&lt;/strong&gt; para la comunidad de la &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/neuroscience&quot;&gt;Facultad de Neurociencias&lt;/a&gt; en King’s College London. Su meta es diseminar habilidades para la Ciencia Abierta en todas las universidades para que cualquier persona pueda adquirirlas tan pronto comience su carrera científica (¡aunque nunca es demasiado tarde!).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;¡Démosle la bienvenida a Sara en el Slack de OLS!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to announce that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#saravilla&quot;&gt;Sara Villa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has joined the OLS team as our newest Senior Resident Fellow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sara-senior-resident-fellow-english&quot;&gt;Sara, Senior Resident Fellow (English)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sara is a researcher with an Open Science obsession that has led her to work as mentor and trainer in programmes like OLS’s &lt;a href=&quot;/openseeds/&quot;&gt;Open Seeds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/nebula/&quot;&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; for the past years.
She is very interested in &lt;strong&gt;Research culture and Community building&lt;/strong&gt; and wants to bring all these skills to anyone involved in doing research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the Turing Way motto, ‘&lt;em&gt;to make Reproducibility too easy not to do&lt;/em&gt;’, she has become an ambassador for Open research at all levels and is very happy to speak up and train (herself and others) whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an OLS Resident Fellow, &lt;strong&gt;Sara will design and develop a tailored Open Seeds programme&lt;/strong&gt; for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/neuroscience&quot;&gt;School of Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; community at King’s College London.
Her ambition is to leak Open Science skills all around Universities so people can learn about it as soon as possible in their scientific journey (but never too late!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please join us in welcoming Sara in the OLS Slack!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Many thanks to the lovely &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#iramosp&quot;&gt;Irene Ramos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, for providing Spanish translation for this blog post!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons from My (first ever!) Public Speaking Coach.</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Public speaking has been one of my strongest skills for the longest time — but like other skills, one can never truly master it, only strive to refine it. I had the privilege of working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidkershaw.net/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Kershaw&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a remarkable public speaking coach provided by the &lt;strong&gt;Society of Research Software Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://society-rse.org/&quot;&gt;SocRSE&lt;/a&gt;), to prepare for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/programme/emerging-voice-plenary/&quot;&gt;Emerging Voices plenary&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;RSECon24&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the very first session, it was clear: this wasn’t just about presenting slides or speaking eloquently. David’s insights elevated public speaking into a craft that intertwines connection, storytelling, and precision. Today, &lt;strong&gt;I’m excited to share some of the gems I’ve learned&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether you’re prepping for a talk, a webinar, or even a casual presentation, these takeaways might just transform how you approach your next speaking opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*eldqEG5ThXNKRRIr_P4HDQ.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;An image of a speaker, Debs, delivering a presentation. Debs is a black female, dressed in a blue and yellow jumpsuit made from African &amp;quot;ankara&amp;quot; prints. Picture shows her side profile, with an RSE banner blurred out in the background.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-main-learning-points&quot;&gt;My Main Learning Points:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;-resonance-and-relevance&quot;&gt;📌 Resonance and Relevance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of every talk are two primary goals: to connect emotionally (resonance) and to deliver intellectually (relevance). Striking the right balance ensures you’re not just heard, but truly remembered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resonance:&lt;/strong&gt; How does my talk appeal to the audience’s emotions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speak to the &lt;strong&gt;heart&lt;/strong&gt;. Relate to your audience on an emotional level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Is my content practical and suited to their needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Speak to the &lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt;. Share information that’s meaningful, accurate, and on point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balance these two, and you’ll have your audience engaged from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-finding-the-right-pace&quot;&gt;📌 Finding the Right Pace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever noticed how a pendulum swings? Left, right, left, right — it’s rhythmic but predictable. As speakers, we risk losing our audience if we’re too slow or overwhelming them if we’re too fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David taught me that pacing can be an art:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go slow&lt;/strong&gt; at strategic moments to let your audience process key ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick up the pace&lt;/strong&gt; when covering familiar or less critical details.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modulate&lt;/strong&gt; — don’t stick to one rhythm. Alternate rhythms to keep things lively — don’t settle into a monotone “pendulum swing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip: Use pauses strategically. They’re like a mental exhale for your audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-passion-is-contagious&quot;&gt;📌 Passion is Contagious&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enthusiasm and confidence are infectious. So, if you show genuine excitement about your topic, your audience will mirror it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David encouraged me to imagine myself as an audience member: &lt;em&gt;How would I expect a confident speaker to act?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line? Own the stage, and don’t be afraid to enjoy the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*YPRapAGhTt_bHZ1Fqdclow.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;A full length image of the same African female, Debs, standing behind a lectern, with arms spread out beside her, as she speaks to an attentive audience.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-the-power-of-rhetorical-questions&quot;&gt;📌 The Power of Rhetorical Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want your audience to think deeply? Ask rhetorical questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-placed rhetorical question not only grabs attention but also invites the audience to ponder, think critically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus tip: Follow it up with a quick one-liner that subtly leads the audience toward the point you’re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance: “Wouldn’t it be great if coffee was free for a day? (&lt;em&gt;pause&lt;/em&gt;) Yeah, I thought so too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-storytelling-the-secret-weaponmore-than-words&quot;&gt;📌 Storytelling: The Secret Weapon/More Than Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories aren’t just for entertainment — they’re a bridge to connect with your audience on a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personal experiences, when shared within appropriate boundaries, create a sense of familiarity and even intimacy. Using metaphors or idioms adds color and paints vivid mental pictures that keep listeners invested and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-keep-them-guessing&quot;&gt;📌 Keep Them Guessing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David encouraged me to embrace the element of surprise. Add something unexpected to your talk — an unconventional approach, a surprising fact, or a playful twist. It keeps the audience on their toes and leaves a lasting impression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-emphasise-new-ideas&quot;&gt;📌 Emphasise new ideas.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: your audience is hearing your material for the first time. Don’t gloss over fresh or complex ideas — slow down, articulate clearly, and make them count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, &lt;em&gt;take your time explaining new ideas so they can fully absorb them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-its-okay-to-say-i-dont-know&quot;&gt;📌 It’s Okay to Say “I Don’t Know”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with a tough question, honesty is key. Acknowledge the person for asking, repeat the question if necessary, and take a moment to process. It’s okay to admit you don’t know the answer — it builds trust and shows humility and authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro tip from my colleague Irene: Repeating the question back to the audience not only buys time but also makes the asker feel heard and valued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-lead-the-slides-dont-let-them-lead-you&quot;&gt;📌 Lead the Slides; Don’t Let Them Lead You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your slides are there to support &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speak before transitioning slides to keep the audience focused on you, not just your visuals. Advancing the slides too soon tempts them to read ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/format:webp/1*atC5QRi3yXegnohWD8bJqA.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Image shows Debs behind a podium, smiling at a large screen above her head, where her slides are being projected for the audience. The current slide reads &amp;quot;OPEN SOURCE OPENS DOORS&amp;quot; with logos of some open source projects below the title.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-final-thoughts-and-acknowledgements&quot;&gt;💭 Final Thoughts and Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with David Kershaw was transformative, not just for my public speaking but for my overall confidence as a communicator. His approach was thoughtful, practical, and tailored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he showed up to our first session with my slides printed out, I knew I was in capable hands. This level of commitment and care made me feel supported and confident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, David, for sharing your wisdom and to the Society of RSE for making this incredible coaching experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re preparing for a talk or just want to sharpen your presentation skills, I hope these lessons resonate with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have questions or thoughts? Let’s keep the conversation going in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Colleagues to Family: Highlights of the OLS Nigeria Meetup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s something magical about meeting people you’ve worked with virtually for ages and instantly feeling like family when you finally see each other in real life. That’s exactly how it felt when &lt;strong&gt;the OLS Nigeria Team met up for the first time&lt;/strong&gt; this past Tuesday, December 17, 2024, at the vibrant Art Tech District in &lt;strong&gt;Abuja&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s set the scene: four of us, coming from different parts of the country, converging in one place. &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#tajuddeen1&quot;&gt;Taj&lt;/a&gt;, our Program Coordinator for the Catalyst project, flew in from Kano; &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#jilaga&quot;&gt;Jilaga&lt;/a&gt;, the creative force behind OLS’s branding, joined us from Lagos; &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#npdebs&quot;&gt;Debs&lt;/a&gt;, our Web Developer and Community Manager extraordinaire, made her way from Port Harcourt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/people.html#seunolufemi123&quot;&gt;Seun&lt;/a&gt;, our Abuja-based Resident Fellow, welcomed us to his city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By noon, we were all gathered, a mix of excitement and slight nervousness in the air—but that didn’t last long. It only took a few minutes of epic banter to break the ice: Debs and Taj debated whether the Art Tech District was really just a 10-minute walk from the hotel, with Seun chiming in to say he doesn’t trust Google Maps. (Spoiler: there’s a hilarious reason Debs and Taj couldn’t agree on the distance—read on!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, we clicked. Big time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kicked off our day with an &lt;strong&gt;escape room challenge&lt;/strong&gt;—“a team-building exercise,” we told ourselves. The mission? Solve a murder case within 30 minutes. Did we crack it? Nope. (Turns out we’re better at our jobs than catching imaginary killers.) But we uncovered bigger mysteries – Taj is great at Chemistry, Jilaga’s an undercover detective, and Seun will seize every opportunity to taunt Debs by fumbling with the light switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next stop: the &lt;strong&gt;Discovery Museum&lt;/strong&gt;. It was a walk through Nigerian history, culture, and creativity. We soaked up every moment, from admiring the exhibits to singing along to iconic Nigerian throwback tunes.  A documentary on the effect of the “Boko Haram” insurgency had us reflecting deeply on the resilience of our nation, and feeling grateful for the gift of life. And, of course, we couldn’t resist snapping photos at every turn…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ols-ng-meetup/ols-ng-collage.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A photo collage containing individual images, each telling a unique story. At the top left corner, the first picture shows two people sitting on a white bench in an art gallery: Seun, an adult black male wearing a blue t-shirt and gray jeans, and Debs, an adult black female with red hair extensions and a purple jumpsuit with white dots. At the top right corner, Seun is smiling in a photo with an adult black female, Jilaga, who has cornrows and dark shades. There are three images in the middle row of the collage: the first photo has Jilaga and Debs standing beside an adult black male, Taj, who is wearing a beige African &amp;quot;senator&amp;quot; outfit with glasses. They are in front of a large screen showing different Nigerian currencies. Next to this image, is a picture showing the evolution of Nigerian music, from 50s to 70s. The last image in the middle row contains traditional beads of the Igbos, and a screen displays palm kernels - above, a sign reads &amp;quot;Igbo culture.&amp;quot; The third and final row of the collage has two images: on the left, Taj, Seun and Jilaga pose for a photo, and on the right, a table is filled with dishes like rice, salad and chow mein.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By lunchtime, the conversation flowed as freely as the food. Fun fact: there’s a short list of things Nigerians love more than good food. We shared bites of our meals, in the same way we dove into each other’s worlds. We shared laughs, swapped stories, and found common ground in our unique journeys within OLS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got to learn about Jilaga’s background in Architecture–mind blown! She also gave us the inside scoop on the intricate process of design and branding. 
Taj, on the other hand, spoke about his academic pursuit, which has taken him across continents, and his growing passion for Project Management and AI.
Meanwhile, Seun talked about his Bioinformatics background, his activity within the OLS and his Community’s participation in The Catalyst project. And Debs? It was a time to reflect on growth and new possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wrap up the day on a sweet note, we made our way to a cozy spot for gelato.  It was the perfect ending to an unforgettable day—because what’s better than bonding over shared love for dessert?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ols-ng-meetup/ols-ng-gelato.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Photo shows four (4) separate cups containing two (2) scoops of gelato. Each cup is placed on a white serviette.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 70%; max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This meet-up wasn’t just a chance to put faces to names; it was a celebration of camaraderie. We may have started the day as colleagues, but by the end of it, we were more like a family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here’s to more in-person meetups! 🥂&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/ols-ng-meetup/ols-ng-cheers.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Photograph shows a group of four (4) raising their glasses in a celebratory toast. The glasses are filled with water, ice cubes and a slice of lemon.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 70%; max-height: 500px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that epic Debs-Taj banter? Here’s the scoop: the city has two Chelsea Hotels, and the whole time, we thought we were staying at the same one. Debs only realised the mix-up when the cab dropped her and Taj off, and Taj headed up to his room—while Debs discovered she was at the wrong place. Luckily, Jilaga swooped in to save the day and took Debs to the right hotel. Classic misadventure, right?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>OLS and Digital Research Academy team up in an OSCARS project to create the OSPARK Bootcamp</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;We are beyond excited to the launch of the &lt;strong&gt;Open Science Promotion and Advocacy for Research Knowledge (OSPARK)&lt;/strong&gt; project, 
a groundbreaking collaboration between &lt;a href=&quot;https://we-are-ols.org/&quot;&gt;Open Life Science&lt;/a&gt; (OLS) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://digital-research.academy/&quot;&gt;The Digital Research Academy&lt;/a&gt; (DRA)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scheduled to begin in &lt;strong&gt;January 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, this 2-year initiative is funded through the &lt;strong&gt;Open Science Clusters’ Action for Research and Society&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://oscars-project.eu/&quot;&gt;OSCARS&lt;/a&gt;), and represents our approach to 
&lt;strong&gt;equipping the Open Science community with practical marketing and communication skills&lt;/strong&gt; to help create visibility for services provided by research support infrastructures as well as for researchers and their research findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSPARK project aims to develop a training program implemented in a &lt;strong&gt;multi-week bootcamp with both online and onsite participation&lt;/strong&gt; to empower members of the OSCARS Science Clusters and the broader Open Science community with evidence-based marketing and communication skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first year of the project, the curriculum for the bootcamp will be developed based on research into both current best-practices and knowledge from experts in the field. Once the curriculum is developed, the bootcamp will be iteratively implemented in the second year to fine-tune the curriculum and participant experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read more about the OSPARK project on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://oscars-project.eu/projects/ospark-bootcamp-open-science-promotion-and-advocacy-research-knowledge-bootcamp&quot;&gt;OSCARS Project Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-about-oscars&quot;&gt;More about OSCARS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSCARS is a four-year EU-funded project that strives to foster the uptake of Open Science in Europe by consolidating the achievements of world-class European research infrastructures in the ESFRI roadmap and beyond into lasting interdisciplinary FAIR data services and working practices. The project aims to strengthen the role of the Science Clusters in the ERA by developing domain-based Competence Centres and by fostering the implementation of Open Science projects funded through a cascading grant mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/logo/OSCARS-logo-EUflag.png&quot; alt=&quot;Photo shows two logos on a plain white background. The logo on the left has the acronym OSCARS, and its meaning &amp;quot;Open Science Clusters&apos; Action for Research &amp;amp; Society&amp;quot; written in black text. The EU logo sits on the right, and is a blue square containing a circle formed by yellow stars. Further right of the blue square, are the words &amp;quot;Funded by the European Union&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;نحن متحمسون لوجود خبرة دعاء وشغفها بالعلوم المفتوحة في الفريق مع نمونا وتواصلنا مع مجتمع أوسع واشمل.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;نرجو منكم الانضمام إلينا في الترحيب بحرارة بدعاء في OLS Slack!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;english&quot;&gt;English&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doaa is an accomplished &lt;strong&gt;Specialist Librarian for Research Services&lt;/strong&gt; at The British University in Egypt, where she has supported over 200 researchers in their work through tailored research support and expertise in open science, research data management, and information literacy.
