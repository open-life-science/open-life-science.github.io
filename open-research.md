As researchers, we value **evidenced-based** behaviours. This means one of our core focuses is creating the **community-based**, **landscape and longitudinal** analyses that inform **open, equitable research practices**. 

We aim to spread effective techniques and reduce ineffective techniques. Studies are run by experienced hands-on practitioners of open research and open community.

## What makes us different

We are researchers with **demonstrated track record** in researching and influencing open. We apply **inclusivity and equity-focused approach** to research by
- **training** and **incubating** independent research leaders, 
- **compensating** contributors, 
- **fostering** collaborations.
