    <p>The development of genome sequencing has lead to an explosion of biological datasets. The primary problem with these datasets is not the data itself, not computational resources, and not the required storage space, but the lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze this data. Solving this problem requires the development of comprehensive educational resources and the training of researchers. With the support of Galaxy community, we launched a project, the Galaxy Training Material (https://training.galaxyproject.org/), to develop a community-driven framework that enables modern, interactive teaching of data analytics in life sciences and facilitates the development of training materials. The result is a collection of online training materials (&gt;80 tutorials, 77 example workflows, 33 interactive tours), developed and maintained by the worldwide Galaxy community (&gt;80 contributors). These materials are used to support both self-directed learning and giving training courses on bioinformatics analyses using Galaxy, an open data integration and analysis platform for the life sciences.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/16">Good Enough Open Source Practices for Data Analysis in Python</a> - Sarah Brown</p>

    <p>I aim to build educational materials and project template resources that facilitate researchers, including novice programmer and researchers rushing toward a prototype tools to take steps toward open source best practices. This is motivated both by my own experiences struggling to get my code to a ‘good enough’ point for release and teaching my research assistants to do so and questions from learners at Carpentries workshops I’ve taught on what to do next. Often people learn the fundamentals of programming, but not of packaging or documenting code. This python and ML/data science catered curriculum and templates will facilitate that. (a better name may happen)</p>

    <p>The present project aims to promote inclusive STEM education &amp; to create (not existing) consistence &amp; compact tactile educational material (Workbooks &amp; 3D prints) on Biology &amp; Astronomy. Although there are a few Graphic Libraries for swell papers (e.g. https://tactilelibrary.com &amp; https://imagelibrary.aph.org/aphb/), there is no a compact tactile educational material, such a Workbook. Students’ will “”learn through making”” (Resnick 2017) taking the lead on developing their own ideas in a learning friendly environment (UNESCO 2015). Students will be asked to work at groups of 2s or 3s in order to create a model/draw. Using our laptops &amp; software the model/draws will be ‘convert’ in vector files and 3D source files. These files will be integrated to tactile Workbooks and the 3D prints.During the Workshops we want the teams to work collaboratively on projects, rely on their passions, in playful spirit (Resnick 2017). The project, by engaging children with Science while having fun, will give us the opportunity to bring to the center of attention children with special educational needs and/or disabilities taking the lead in actions and -moreover- a context where children can develop social skills, make friends (Panagiotidou 2016) and ‘learning through making’ (Resnick 2017).</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/40">Rapid Reviews for Outbreak Science</a> - Michael Johansson</p>

    <p>Based on experiences in the H1N1 influenza, chikungunya, Ebola, and Zika epidemics, we founded Outbreak Science (https://outbreakscience.org/) to improve the use of science to fight epidemics by driving early and open dissemination of data, code, and analytical results. We identified preprints, manuscripts shared publicly prior to peer review, as a key opportunity to share data, methods, and results months before peer-reviewed manuscripts (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549). However, preprints also bring new challenges as they can contain important scientific information but also opinions or erroneous research. We thus need ways to rapidly filter preprints so that scientists, policy makers, and lay readers alike can quickly identify the most important scientific information.Through discussions with scientists and policy makers, we identified the need for a tool for rapid, structured, open scientific reviews (very early prototype: https://t.co/acDeHAyHI3). This tool can leverage the broad scientific engagement that occurs during outbreaks. Scientists who read preprints can rapidly provide high-level assessment in minutes rather than the hours that formal peer review requires. And those reviews can be shared immediately and openly unlike most peer reviews. The context of outbreaks is particularly important, but this tool should have much broader potential use, across science and possibly beyond. Open development is thus not just a way to support development, but also key to ensuring that the tool is sufficiently adaptable to be used more broadly.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/103">Open Collaborations: From Local Contributions To Global Recognition</a> - Valentin Danchev</p>

    <p>This project will develop an application of blockchain for scientific collaboration with the goal of minimizing gender and status biases in collaborative research, thereby fostering open distributed collaboration. In many online communities, professional sport, and online kitchens nowadays, individual contributions and exchanges are openly available and can easily translate into globally recognizable reputations. In science, however, the very process of doing research collaboratively remains a relatively closed system. By design, local individual contributions and collaborative transactions are not transparently demarcated, possibly contributing to gender and status inequalities as well as to “the rich get richer” dynamics. This project will prototype an open source platform that integrates distributed scientific contributions among collaborators, from ideation to outcome, based on blockchain technology. By designing a blockchain implementation that assembles traceable bits of contributions necessary for assigning credit on the basis of performance instead of status signals, I want to contribute to a more open, inclusive, and reproducible collaborative research.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/47">Science Communication Magazine</a> - Maria Bonatelli</p>

    <p>I always had the concern about how to impact and inspire other people to do Science Communication, even though I understand that the main pressure that undergrad and graduate students suffer in university is to publish papers in high impact magazines. But maybe a way to stimulate them to do SciComm is if this production could have a similar value to a scientific paper. Any student that have the desire to share their research to the non-specialized public should be able to do it. But since students are not usually trained to produce SciComm articles, we will offer an online course to capacitate them to produce SciComm article. After, they will send us their article and a group of specialized volunteers will evaluate it. In the end, we will have a quality SciComm product publish in a Magazine that will also have great value to the student curriculum.</p>

    <p>I have built a few citizen science games that have proven useful for my research. The breakthrough I had was optimizing my app for mobile. Inspired by Tinder, in braindr (brain data review, https://braindr.us) , you swipe left to fail, or right to pass, the quality of a brain MRI scan. In whaledr (https://whale-dr.firebaseapp.com), you see a spectrogram and hear a 5 second clip of an underwater ocean recording, and swipe right if you hear a whale call.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/MozillaFestival/open-leaders-6/issues/20">Openscapes</a> - Julia Stewart Lowndes</p>

    <p>Openscapes will help increase the value and practice of open data science in environmental science. Building off of five years of work with the Ocean Health Index (ohi-science.org), Openscapes will focus on engagement and guidance, to excite and connect researchers to existing open tools and communities that can amplify their research.</p>

    <p><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#mbac-computer-vision-tool-for-bacterial-motility-assays">MBac - Computer vision tool for bacterial motility assays</a> - Alexander Kutschera</p>

    <p>Bacterial surface colonization and biofilm formation depends on motility in surface environments. Therefore studying bacterial motility is very important to better understand bacterial virulence and persistence. Unfortunately setups vary quite a lot and the reproducibility of bacterial motility assays is comparatively low. For this reason I want to develop an open source imaging setup and computer vision based software to perform and analyse bacterial motility assays!</p>

    <p>Reflectometry researchers must understand plasma physics, microwave propagation, RF electronics and data processing; taking months to years browsing publications and dissertations, before becoming productive. The Open Reflectometry Project aims i) to facilitate the knowledge transfer and collaboration between reflectometry researchers; ii) to educate plasma physicists and engineers that use reflectometry data; iii) and to improve the transparency and reliability of reflectometry diagnostic data.</p>

    <p>This project propose to translate the open research outputs in agriculture to local languages like Amharic and also making the translation of the scientific terms to everyday language that the farmers can understand. The translations will be openly available using an online platform to farmers and also to the public so that it facilitates citizen engagement in open science including data collection and data analysis which will promote citizen science to increase agricultural productivity.</p>

    <p>In Evolutionary Biology, the presence/absence pattern of a gene over a set of species is called its “phylogenetic profile”. Phylogenetic profiling is a technique for finding the biological relationships between genes. Due to the uninformative of the basic profile, I am developing PhyloProfile, a visualization method that allows to enrich regular profiles with further data, to make phylogenetic profiling more meaningful. PhyloProfile is open source written in R, making heavy use of Shiny library.</p>

    <p>Many fields of science are far behind adopting open scientific practices (e.g. share code). I believe these will be a requirement for publication in the future. However, one of the biggest challenges for many researchers/scientists is that it’s not (at this point) easy to do these practices. This toolkit will simplify and automate many of these tasks. I have already started work on this software project with prodigenr (https://github.com/lwjohnst86/prodigenr).</p>

    <p><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#contextexplorer-analysis-of-organized-cell-behavior">ContextExplorer: Analysis of organized cell behavior</a> - Joel Ostblom</p>

    <p>I want to understand mammalian development and contribute to regenerative medicine cell therapies against currently untreatable diseases. As part of my PhD project, I am using Python and Qt to develop a GUI-driven image data processing application to help biologists study organized cellular behavior in this context in a quantitative manner. These analysis methods are currently not accessible to scientists without a programming background, which is hindering widespread study of these biological processes.</p>

    <p><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#ignite">IGNITE</a> - Gracielle Higino</p>

    <p>This project aims to put up a training and incentive program in Science Communication to young scientists. The first step would be to gather information about scientists’ needs and worries when they are asked to do SciComm. The next step will be to put up (fun and not much time consuming) training modules focused on these information. We will also look for international applications for funding, so we could offer a fellowship for the trainees or a prize in a contest at the end of the training.</p>

    <p><a href="https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#me-bids">ME-BIDS</a> - Elizabeth DuPre</p>

    <p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used tool providing a non-invasive, high-resolution index of brain activity. Recently, the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) was introduced to standardize fMRI data sets, enabling data discovery and—through associated BIDS Apps—analysis. A remaining challenge of fMRI data is its sensitivity to artifacts. Multi-echo analysis (Kundu et al., 2011, NeuroImage) was developed to address this; however, no multi-echo BIDS App currently exists.</p>

    <p>StoryEngine is an impact narrative method that can be used for research, evaluation/assessments, and grant reporting – all the while creating useful communication/marketing/onboarding/network-building assets for both participants and the organization. It is unique because it is open, adaptable, and seeks to provide value to participants (many similar methods are extractive, never giving back to interviewees).</p>

    <p>Digital safety is a new and evolving issue in academia. Scholars who wish to work openly do not have time to investigate the topic in addition to their already full teaching and research schedules. Few online resources exist to address these issues in an academic context. We hope to empower researchers/instructors to take charge of their own digital safety through the creation of an online toolkit that can be used at point of need and incorporated into higher education coursework.</p>

    <p>Our project aims to disseminate open source practices among high school teachers by co-prototyping with them an open air quality monitor, publishing open air quality data they can reuse with students and documenting the experience in an OER kit. We want teachers to experience the potential that open practices have to address local community issues. Teachers can play a key role in influencing students towards local social innovation, but most of them feel ‘outdated’ regarding ICTs.</p>

    <p>FlyCAGE is a web application that allow users to search for genes in fruit flies that follow a specific expression pattern. The user can either enter a known gene name to find other genes with similar expression profiles, or the user can enter a custom expression pattern based on experimental data to find genes that follow the pattern. FlyCAGE would be useful in identifying candidate genes involved in a given process and discovering regulatory interactions in genetic networks.</p>

    <p>Open Stories aims to gather success stories of Open advocates and practitioners to show that a successful Open career is possible. Many researchers view Open as a potential risk and they may not see their fields represented in well-known Open advocates. By collecting Open success stories and making them discoverable by storyteller location, discipline, career level, and language, we can better represent the success stories of open practitioners and encourage other researchers to go Open.</p>

    <p>My project aims to increase awareness of the importance of open source code in science - like all science, code too should be subject to peer review. I would like to conduct research into <em>why</em> code isn’t treated as peer-reviewable science, and curate relevant resources from related open science/open source efforts. This would probably come in the form of interactive workshops and an online survey, with all results shared openly on the project website &amp; hopefully published in scientific journals</p>

    <p>Open Science Hardware is a new field in Open Science and integral part of Open Innovation. Education and experimental sciences are inherently dependent on instrumentation which becomes increasingly digital and shareable. Yet, open hardware faces many challenges around documentation, sharing and replication that are different from open source software! DocuBricks and the Journal of Open Hardware are open, digital (scientific) infrastructure projects aiming to close the gap!</p>

    <p>The HBASet project will develop an online, web browser based portal for creating molecular maps of where and when gene sets are expressed in the mouse, monkey and human brains. The tool will take a gene set as input and output interactive visualizations and statistical tests showing the enrichment of expression at a specific developmental time point, brain region, cell type and species. The tool will simplify the examination of expression patterns of a set of genes (polygenic) in the brain.</p>

    <p>Most of the existing studies in medicine or psychology are governed by a divide between researchers and participants. Very often, research is focused on underrepresented minority groups, but without explicitly taking their needs and feedback into account. In this project, we plan to collectively design a questionnaire that will be addressed to vulnerable populations and will assess how these populations perceive research done on them.</p>

    <p>I want to create an open source web application that addresses stigma associated with mental illness. Mental health issues can be viewed on a spectrum. With this in mind, I want users of Mental Hues to be able to create a Hue, or topic, related to mental health. When a Hue has been created, users can write a story related to the Hue to share their experiences. I believe the best way to diminish stigma is to personalize the issues and allow people to relate to them.</p>

    <p>We will develop a survey to explore the underlying reasons for failure to adopt open-science (OS) practices in academia. The survey will seek to: 1) Understand researchers’ knowledge of and engagement with OS practices; 2) Learn about obstacles that prevent them from engaging in OS practices; 3) Ask what would incentivize them to adopt OS practices. First we will test the survey in our home institutions, but our goal is to distribute the survey to other academic institutions across the globe.</p>
