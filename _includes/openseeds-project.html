      <td>This project aims to create a community of local scientists to share and promote open science in Barcelona, Spain. I would like to use as an example the <a href="https://openscience-utrecht.com/">OSCU</a> and other initiatives like openscience beers in Montreal. The initial goal would be to reach researchers from different institutions: UB, UPC, UPF, UOC, UAB, etc. and meet informally in a bar/pub periodically.<br>During the meetings we would present/talk about what we do, we will promote knowledge exchange and will discuss on how we could improve our research in terms of open science, for example performing more transparent research and sharing data/code. Later on, the plan is to use this community to create workshops and symposia about open science and to agree on some common needs. For example, a common need in life science research group would be to have resources to help researchers in terms of data sharing or interactive paper publication. If we can define common needs we will be able to apply for some funding to cover them.<br>We will also use this plantform to motivate colleages from other parts of the country to create their own local community and then connect for some events.</td>

      <td><a href="https://pypi.org/project/plenpy/">plenoptic</a> is a Python package for computational vision with two main components: standard differentiable models of the visual system and synthesis methods. The models operate on images and make predictions about perception or neural activity, and are relatively simple, with a small number of parameters; they can thus be used out-of-the-box on arbitrary images. To start, we will focus on spatial vision, so the inputs are expected to be static grayscale images. Synthesis methods are used to better understand models of this type. The most common applications of computational models are simulation (holding the parameters and input constant, while predicting the output) and learning (holding the input and output constant, while fitting the parameters). In synthesis, the output and parameters are held constant while the input is fit. This allows scientists to develop better intuition about which aspects of images their models consider relevant and which they ignore, as well as to carry out more efficient and effective model comparison and validation experiments. We will include four such methods, all of which have been described in the literature, but none of which have standard, accessible implementations that work on more than a handful of specific models.</td>

Here, we propose the development of AMRITA, an online web-based library of medicinal herbs that include their phylogeny, medicinal properties, known active components and related scientific literatures that is open publicly to the research community world-wide. This platform would facilitate the collaboration of researchers across the fields of biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical sciences in establishing a solid foundation of medicinal plants and enabling the use of these plants in modern medicine.</td>

Then, I would like to curate existing content, repackage it in an easily accessible and “digestable” form, add to it, but also create readily usable tools (e.g. templates - not just things people have to read). Topics would include how to work openly and inclusively (e.g. lab codes of conduct, lab manuals, leading inclusive meetings, setting up a healthy lab culture etc.); how to do research open (preprints, toolkits with software to work open, project management tools etc.); how to train the next generation of open scientists; and how to open your work to the public. Finally, I would like to approach organisations and institutions to help more young PIs get access to these resources.</td>

This willinvolve distributing my current research findings widely through blogs andconference talks, and these efforts will enable the formation of communityconnections to initiate a working group for open science in my field.There are currently working groups for nomenclature and morphometrics inphytolith analysis as part of the International Phytolith Society. Initialefforts of the working group would be to investigate the best ways to sharedata, developing resources/training opportunities for students and earlycareer researchers, and recommending/publishing guidelines for colleaguesto follow.</td>

There are specific challenges for using this formatwithin this field; some practical and some metascientific. A central issueis that the existing format for registered reports focuses on hypothesistesting, whereas neurophysiology is quite often an exploratory anditerative process. Working with NHPs is a necessarily limited privilegeand comes with considerable responsibility; the cost of having experimentswhere the results are not robust, or where opportunities for discoveryare missed, is particularly high, since opportunity for replication islimited. Therefore, peer review in advance of performing an experimentseems a particularly valuable idea.

This involves quantification of thecurrent energy demand of housing archetypes and physics-based modelling toevaluate the impact of energy-efficiency technologies available to be installedin the home during the retrofit process. However, uncertainty exists due to alack of monitored data on indoor air temperature, which leads to a performancegap between modelled and monitored energy demand as heating practices are themost sensitive parameter within building energy modelling. Further uncertaintyis acknowledged due to a lack of longitudinal data following retrofit. Suchdata could inform the evaluation of long-term impacts of technologies installed,to inform future decision making. Motivated householders who are planning orrecently completed a retrofit project might be interested to share data, perhapsin return for research insight on the impacts and success of similar projectsthrough a citizen science approach. This is an idea in development for follow-onresearch which requires data collection protocols, ethical guidelines and datarepositories.</td>

      <td>Citizen science revolves around the idea of integrating the public in scientific research. However, there are different interpretations of this idea. An important part of citizen science projects allows laymen only to participate in a limited scope of microtasks and keeps thus reinforcing the power gap between academic scientists and the public. Literature has called for more autonomy of citizen scientists by allowing them to participate in more phases of the research cycle. Commons-based peer-production, an alternative mode of production in which people self-organize to develop complex knowledge-commons like Wikipedia or open software, seems to be a promising approach to facilitate this. However, a design-centred approach implementing this for a specific use case is yet to be done. In my PhD project I am trying to fill this gap by redesigning the online ecosystem of Open Humans - an existing community of practice around citizen science - collaborating closely with this community in a user-centered design approach. As one of the first steps, I am working on a best practices guide, summarizing the experiences of existing similar projects.</td>

Importantly, metrics derived from actigraphy are being increasingly used in clinical contexts, where groups of psychiatric and neurological patients in specific conditions have found to be exhibit abnormal rest-activity rhythms and sleep. Sleep and circadian parameters from actigraphy are derived measures. These are obtained by converting the movements counts (usually obtained at a resolution of 1 minutes) into sleep parameters and circadian metrics using&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithms raging from threshold-based computations to machine learning techniques. Unfortunately, at present, there are no standards or schemas for specifying and sharing actigraphy data and corresponding algorithms.The goal of this project is to develop a common schema for the use, analysis, reporting and open and interoperable sharing of actigraphy data across different actigraphy devices produced by different commercial manufacturers and for use by researchers and research users.

However, up-to-date documentation listing the current contributors and links to their algorithms is currently missing. Optionally, we can add other information like literature references.

      <td>Phytoliths are microfossils of plants used world-wide to address a variety of questions in fields like archaeology, palaeoecology and palaeontology. Diverse laboratory procedures, analyses and identification criteria are used resulting from different research traditions. Some steps, such as the normalisation of nomenclature through the International Phytolith Society, have been promoted to standardise the phytolith analysis and the subsequent publication of data. However, the standardisation of phytolith research and data publication is still far from being achieved. Moreover, a recent assessment of the data sharing practices within the phytolith community found only half of the publications share some form of data and the majority do not provide reusable data. This project has grown from initial efforts by Emma Karoune during OLS2 to raise awareness of issues with poor data sharing practice. It is part of a broader initiative supported by the International Phytolith Society on data sharing and represents the first steps towards the FAIRification of phytolith data: an evaluation of sharing practices in phytolith research; the creation of a GitHub repository for collaborative use by this working group and in the forthcoming FAIRification project; and the development of a webpage to provide the community with information as the project proceeds.</td>

      <td>Obesity causes approximately 4.7 million premature deaths annually, which accounts for a loss of ca. 8% globally. Obesity is an outcome of complex, heritable, and multi-factorial interaction of multiple genes, environmental factors, and behavioral traits that makes management and prevention challenging in the human population (Rao et al., 2014). Experimental research has demonstrated that altered metabolites in multiple metabolic pathways are associated with obesity (Zhao et al.,2016). Alteration in the proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the gut microbiome can trigger obesity. The gut microbiome's influence on obesity is much more complicated than the imbalance of these bacteria species. Modulation of the gut microbiome through diet, prebiotics, surgery, and antibiotics significantly affects the obesity epidemic (John & Mullin, 2016). It is one of the enormous global health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality mediated by its association with several other metabolic disorders (Saini et al., 2018). We aim to target obesity and diabetes-associated metabolic disorders and annotate the genes common to these complex diseases using a systems genomic integrated approach, thereby using Galaxy as a platform.</td>

Currently, twelve teams of students and researchers from different institutions contribute to field data collection for SIAgroBD. While we are committed to open practices at CONABIO and all collected data are open, some external contributors lack the skills to use these data, even if they have helped collect them, and are not familiar with open practices. Thus my project consists in developing training materials (OER) for an introductory workshop on open data with a focus on FAIR principles, biodiversity standards, effective management strategies, among other skills that encourage contributors to become active users of data apart from collectors. The integration of social and biological information and the use of Indigenous data are distinctive features of agrobiodiversity research in Mexico that will also be addressed. I expect this serves as a prototype for advanced training modules that could be used by future contributors or other researchers working on agrobiodiversity topics.</td>

The project aims to use the methods of empirical legal scholarship to describe and categorize the ways postdoctoral scholars and their appointments have been involved in the legal system. Briefly, empirical legal scholarship is a form of qualitative or mixed-methods research, often involving content analysis, that uses legal documents or decisions as its data source. We are not aware of any other research applying this method or data source to the study of postdocs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, there has been little research of any kind on the legal aspects of postdoc appointments.Building on a “file drawer” paper by Jennifer Miller (with Kristina Van Buskirk), we frame our project around the question of whether postdocs are employees or students. Based on economic theory, we expect the types of cases to reflect whether postdocs are employees producing in a labor market or students consuming in a services market.

Ten thousand tweets will be extracted per language via the Twitter API. Thereafter, the tweets will be annotated by native annotators for each of the languages. These annotators will be hired and trained to perform the annotation. The annotation tasks consist of labeling each tweet as either positive, negative or neutral.To mitigate errors and bias, each dataset will be annotated by three different annotators. After which the project team will compute the kappa agreement between the annotators&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigerian Sentiment Lexicon: In the same way, manual annotation of the tweets will be used to create the sentiment lexicon for each of the three languages. The sentiment lexicon annotation task involves Identifying sentiment bearing words from each tweet and assigning a sentiment score between +1 to +5 (with 1 being the most negative sentiment and +5 the most positive sentiment).&nbsp;&nbsp;Nigerian Hate Speech Lexicon: Extreme negative sentiment from the sentiment lexicon will be used to develop the hate speech lexicon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Annotation tool: We plan to use a web-based annotation tool, brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012) which has been proved to be efficient for this type of task by many researchers. The annotators must be native speakers of the language and follow the annotation guidelines provided by the project teams.&nbsp;&nbsp; HausaNLP aims to create more language resources that can be used to train models in machine learning.</td>

The ProCAncer-I project brings together 20 partners, including PCa centers of reference, world leaders in AI, and innovative SMEs, with the objective to design, develop, and sustain a cloud-based, secure European Image Infrastructure with tools and services for data handling. The platform hosts the largest collection of PCa multi-parametric (mp)MRI, anonymized image data worldwide (>17,000 cases), based on data donorship, in line with EU legislation (GDPR). Robust AI models are developed, based on novel ensemble learning methodologies, leading to vendor-specific and -neutral AI models for addressing 8 PCa clinical scenarios. To accelerate the clinical translation of PCa AI models, we focus on improving the trust of the solutions with respect to fairness, safety, explainability, and reproducibility. A roadmap for AI models certification is defined, interacting with regulatory authorities, thus contributing to a European regulatory roadmap for validating the effectiveness of AI-based models for clinical decision making.</td>

      <td>Recent developments in electron microscopy have led to a significant scale-up in the imaging of biological tissues, making throughput a major bottleneck for further progress. Electron microscopes are inherently throughput limited. A new type of scanning electron microscopy, the multibeam electron microscopy, speeds up imaging by scanning the sample with an array of beams instead of a single beam. Furthermore, this microscope makes use of a new detection system based on transmitted electrons and scintillation photons, which provides comparable information to conventional detection methods. To make use of the full potential of this microscope, new methods for data management, data analysis and visualization have to be designed. For example, we would like to employ deep learning methods for automatic segmentation. We would like to apply the multibeam electron microscope to study mitotic cells, zebrafish development and pancreatic stress.</td>

This project aims to adapt the Citizen Science approach in Saudi Arabia to bring together researchers with citizens. Our lab focus is the use of metagenomics of Natural Products (NPs) and it is based on King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC). Metagenomics of NPs is an innovative approach that utilizes next-generation sequencing to study microorganisms via the analysis of their DNA acquired directly from an environmental sample. The screening of natural product extracts has traditionally been the most effective method for identifying new compounds with unique cellular targets which are potentially useful as lead structures for the development of new therapeutics. However, there is hardly any known project which utilises Citizen Science in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we are collaborating with Open Science community Saudi Arabia (OSASA) to adapt this approach in our current project. This project will engage citizen scientists in collecting and examining soil samples from various regions in Saudi Arabia and bring awareness about the role of Citizen Science in research as&nbsp;&nbsp;part of the Research Hub.</td>

Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two). &nbsp;Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it.

      <td>The international and open RIVER UNIVERSITY started in Poland with its pilot in 2018 and the 1st edition in 2020.Its professional river education has the ambition to change the reality by creating a strong center/network of modern knowledge, linking experts and giving the opportunity to participants to learn about the peculiarities of different rivers in the Baltic region and in Europe.We provide tools to use in practice, exchange information and experience about inland waters and its impact on the Baltic Sea, to spark joint initiatives for the sake of rivers’ good condition.Riverine topics always reflect source-to-sea approach and relation to current trends, challenges, legislation regarding freshwaters, and free-flowing rivers: restore nature law, UN restoration decade, Biodiversity strategy 2030, European Green Deal, national recovery plans, etc.In 2018, the River University mostly served for the purpose of gathering river experts from several transboundary basins of Poland (Odra, Vistula/Western Bug, Neman) with their counterparts from Belarus and Ukraine to discuss i.a. issues related to inland navigation and large infrastructure projects on straightening river flows in these countries. 1st edition of River University in 2020 provided general solid knowledge about healthy rivers, their benefits and threats, presented one of the most stunning rivers in Poland – Drawa river and highlighted current riverine challenges impacting the society. All these looking towards European community goals, as usual.During the 2nd edition in 2021, we swim into Lithuania’s waters, to dive deep – finally live! – into water challenges in the next country in the Baltic region. We will get to know best practices of good water management, experience with transboundary river cooperation, also innovations and developments within sewerage system management. We can already read about flood risk management and about river barriers to remove or mitigate in the Baltic Sea Region (https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_flood-risk-management-in-the-baltic-sea-region_2021.pdf, https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_report_dam_removal_april_2021.pdf). This time we ask – how are the Lithuanian rivers?Being a visitor of the largest protected area in Lithuania, crossing rivers outdoor, stepping into practical lectures in the national park, we will also ask about how to limit riverine pollution from tourism and how the connectivity of amazing Lithuanian rivers is ensured.Checking the European background: how the situation of rivers in Europe looks like in general? Later in time, I may widen it to Europe, not only the Baltic region.River University has been granted patronage from European Parliament and I seek and encourage water-related institution patronage at every edition. It engages top-level lecturers and universities and practitioners, e.g.: the University of Lausanne, Warsaw University of LifeSciences, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries.</td>

I will build upon the Open Source community health metric ([https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community\_Health](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health)), which involves evaluating contributors' group that is actively involved in a project, number of new contributors that join the project, and members who leave. For online projects, it can also involve tracking the number of community ambassadors, the number of return attendees to events and the rate of churned attendees. Developing an ideal metric in this project will require further deliberation and consultation from The Turing Way team and core contributors. Hence, this project will be collaboratively designed with other community members by actively inviting their contributions and thoughts.</td>

The goal is to popularise and raise local researchers' awareness of open science practices and platforms and thus to tackle the existing structural barriers (e.g., linguistic, epistemic, etc.) in accessing the information and disseminating the research from Central Asia. Currently, the local scholarship is located - geographically, linguistically, epistemically - in the global periphery which hinders the knowledge production, use, and dissemination in the region. Many scholars, as the result, become trapped in fraudulent research and publication practices. Moreover, there are cases when openly accessible educational resources are offered to researchers as a marketable product. So, to address these and other issues related to inaccessibility of knowledge production infrastructure, this project aims to create an openly accessible, fair, and multilingual educational resource about open science with the particular focus on Central Asia. To this end, I am planning to use Jupyter Notebook and create a platform similar to [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome).</td>

Researchers should be able to survey a variety of models that target phenomena at different scales; ranging from process-based models of the cellular determinants of wood formation, to empirical models of gross tree growth in different environmental contexts. The linked information should allow complex questions to be asked, including: how similar models differ; which datasets can be repurposed to test different model outputs; and identifying&nbsp;&nbsp; whether and how different models can be composed together. This will promote open scientific practices in this research area (through the use of common metadata standards and terms), and may serve as a valuable framework for collaborative knowledge capture and exploration.</td>

Our goal was to create a tool that can automatically generate large datasets that can be used in research for data-driven catalyst discovery.The issue was that a simple SMILES representation of a molecular scaffold does not work when it contains a transition metal complex. With this tool we use the 3D coordinates of a molecular scaffold and let the user place molecular fragments to create many variations of this scaffold. Other inorganic chemistry fields that use transition-metal containing molecules might benefit from this tool as well. A first prototype is published, but several things can be done to increase the usability of our tool.</td>

      <td>[_A History of Research Ethics_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/) is a free, online resource for researchers, governance professionals, and even college students to learn about science and ethics, and be inspired to develop practical tools for the assurance of adequately conducted research.&nbsp;&nbsp;A key purpose of _A History of Research Ethics_ is to demonstrate the variety of disciplines and backgrounds that research ethics can draw on. In other words, interdisciplinarity is critical for its success. This means both interdisciplinary contributions _and_ adapting to audiences from diverse fields and sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;By embracing the collaborative nature of GitHub and OLS' open science community, I expect to take _A History of Research Ethics_ to its next stage of development.</td>

The first phase of this study involved target validation, primer, and probe design using open-access tools. Here, a principal component analysis (PCA) of the R/adegenet package (Jombart et al, 2010) and phylogenetic tree (Neighbour-joining) using R/ape package (Paradis et al, 2004) to cluster repeats of the chosen amplification target. These clusters were aligned to generate a consensus sequence for designing primers and probes for establishing the LAMP assay. I have designed an incorporated strand displacement probe using the engineering guideline of Juan et al, 2015 and the open-access Nupack software tool. The assay has and the master mix is being lyophilized for further experimental evaluation.The sensitivity of this kit will be evaluated on extracted DNA from three sample types: saliva, urine, and clinical blood, with crude samples, lysed using lysis buffer. Correlation generated from these results will inform the best sensitive amplification. Further, a possible decay of the lyophilised master mix will be evaluated for six months to ascertain possible shelf-life.</td>

During the OLS program, we aim to build an open community around Hub23 to help to guide future technical developments, and encourage use and contributions from the wider Turing community. We will host a series of Zero-to-Binder workshops aimed at introducing Turing researchers to regular binder, followed by structured discussion of what the ideal features of a collaborative reproducible environment for research would be.

Key data will be automatically extracted, synthesized, and made available alongside the one directly uploaded. All the available demographic, behavioral, clinical, and cognitive data will be properly organized and mapped onto the neural data to allow statistical analysis (i.e., data-driven lesion-symptom mapping). Ultimately, probabilistic maps synthesizing transdiagnostic information on lesion-symptom mapping would be constantly updated as more data are gathered. To this end, data visualization will be critical (e.g. https://speechbrainviewer.com/). Overall, the platform will1. enable sharing of FAIR neuropsychological datasets across research centres and groups;2. foster understanding of the topographical distribution and morphological characteristics of brain lesions;3. allow large-scale, data-driven exploration of the associations between behavior and cognitive symptoms and brain regions.</td>

"Open Science, Open Future" aims to be an educational resource to be used online by young scientists: undergraduates, MSc students, and potentially high-school pupils. The curriculum will consist of several modules explaining why each aspect of the OS practice can improve research and make it fairer (e.g. best practices in sharing protocols, storing data, publishing, collaborating).

      <td>Open Science for Improve diagnostics of Cancer through Artificial Intelligence and Digital Pathology.Cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent among the group of treatable diseases in African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 10% of histopathology needs are met and this is a major barrier to comprehensive management of cancers1. There is a shortage of clinicians and pathologists available for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the critical factors in treatment efficiency is the correct and timely diagnosis of specimens by pathologists. However, there is currently a significant shortage of cancer care clinicians in Africa and an even more considerable shortage of pathologists. In Cameroon, there are 19 pathologists currently in practice for 22,179,707 inhabitants2. The absolute number of patients with cancer in Cameroon was estimated to be 25,000 cases a year.Diagnosis of cancer relies on histology in nearly 80% of cases, cytology in 10%, and clinical diagnosis in 10% (1). There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of&nbsp;&nbsp; cancers, to increase cancer treatment efficacy and reduce overtreatment of tumors clinically suspicious for malignancy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We propose a hybrid diagnosis method with a deep Learning algorithm applied on hematoxylin and eosin histology slides. Digital microscopy and telepathology were already successfully used to mitigate the lack of pathologists in Cameroon, thus confirming the availability of a robust dataset for our project (1). Following splitting into training, validation and test sets, we will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm before deployment and tests. In addition to automated diagnostic, the developed program will have specific features such as sample information storage and tracking software as well as image optimization and analysis tools.1.

I believe new systems and easier ways of accessing information with more vocal communities are needed to usher in the new generation. But to do so, the new bachelor and high school students must be the recipient of effective scientific communication to help them realize the existing communities and opportunities in life science research in India. As a penultimate bioengineering student, my exposure to existing communities is recent and new. This fact allows me to understand and appreciate the importance of such communities in guiding students with a passion for research in life sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Science in 2022 India is a concept that seeks to unite parallel enterprises by individuals across the nation under one banner.&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal is to provide a complete and interconnected picture of Life Science research and communities in India. Simultaneously, as a founder of a Bioengineering Chapter in my institution, I will be applying our findings to build and train my colleagues and juniors to have the tools and awareness to choose their next steps in research.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we measure the success of this project through the successful publication of a paper that encompasses the findings and suggestions for building a better and more robust open community of life science research in India.</td>

The project focus is to develop an open online support resource for primary mental health catered to researchers particularly scientific researchers. This platform will contain educational materials concerning emotional health which sits at the core of mental health. It will also contain self-assessment tools and techniques for developing mental resilience. In addition to that, the resource will contain a peer support network that will offer help and emotional support. The overall objective is to avail help, progress monitoring and increased understanding of the importance of mental health wellbeing among researchers.</td>

There are quite a number of some initiatives in Nigeria such as AI Hub, Nigeria, Python Nigeria and R User groups that mainly promote data science and computational sciences. However, none there exist a single community that instilled responsible conduct of research, promote the principles of open science and or establish a guiding principles and core values or policies that support scientists, researchers, and societal stakeholders to meet, inspire and co-create important things together as a community. Thus, we aim to establish and develop an open science community in Nigeria where newcomers and experienced peers interact, inspire each other to adopt Open Science practices and values, identify opportunities and pitfalls, and provide feedback on policies, infrastructure, and support services as does in other regions of the World. We aim to specifically target scientists, researchers and students who are passionate about open science but have little to no experience with open science principles and practices.</td>

By creating a semantic overview of the interaction between skills, technologies and the key role-players in the RSE community, this ontology will be able to provide information on the research fields that each RSE has background knowledge in, their development skills, and the services that they are willing to provide clients, enabling a way in which suitable RSEs can be assigned to projects where they will be able to provide software development and software-development-related assistance. This project also aligns with the thinking supported by Open Science, as the ontology is aimed to be reusable and reproducible.</td>

At the hackathon, participants can either come up with their own problem statements or chose one to work on from our list. The questions will focus on: (1) difficulties that prevent them from fully implementing and practicing some or all aspects of OS in their science networks/ institutions/universities, and (2) problems that can be solved through OS. OILS will provide support to the participants by tapping into the OS&nbsp;&nbsp;network in Switzerland and introducing them to necessary experts and tools. An example of such a problem could be the absence of a searchable data repository in their university that contains links to all published datasets from the participating research groups - such an infrastructure would encourage the generation and sharing of well-annotated data. At the end of the event, ideally, the participants would have actionable steps and solutions that either can be directly implemented by them or proposed to competent authorities.

      <td>Ages fraud scandals have tarnished African sport at the international level. In 2009, FIFA adopted MRI as an age determination tool for its youth level competitions but recent studies show that bone age assessment has a very large margin of error and cannot be a standard for determining apparent age when we know that environmental factors greatly influence the development of the child. There are populations in which the disappearance of growth cartilage is 4 to 5 years earlier than in another. The ugly face of the problem is that many children are born out of the healthcare system.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cameroon, approximately 1.7 million children, or 66 %, do not have a birth certificate. These children are said to be "invisible" In other words, they live without being recognised by the country whose citizenship they claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a study carried out by Unicef, 40,000 children, in the Far North region alone, will find it difficult to present their end of year First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) for lack of a birth certificate. To establish these birth certificates, it will be necessary to make an estimate of their apparent age in a complex process which discourages parents. It is evident that the determination of apparent age should not only be seen from a clinical standpoint. Instead, socio-cultural and environment factors must also be taken into account. To remedy this situation which has reached the alert level, it is urgent to propose a simplified and open system for determining Apparent Age to turn invisible kids to visible ones based on available Data and Machine Learning techniques.</td>

      <td>Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role in openly sharing scientific knowledge with a worldwide audience (among both academic and non-academic audiences) and encouraging reproducibility. But OD is much less developed in Humanities and Social Science (HSS) research, primarily because of the levels of sensitivity of the data involved, and consent required from participants, which could be difficult for researchers, especially if they are new to data sharing. With the growing interest in computing, researchers working in Computational Social Science (CSS) face similar issues when working with social data in their research, while conforming to legal and ethical restrictions. As per OD guidelines, data must comply with the FAIR principles. But the metrics offered by various OD repositories and publication platforms could be different, which limits the affordances of social activity and the type of OD published.&nbsp;&nbsp; To embrace Open Science projects among HSS and CSS researchers who are working or looking to work with sensitive data, this project proposes a platform (or hub) to promote free, online resources for both professionals and students looking to learn about science and ethics. Here, they can also contribute to discussions related to the topic, post questions, and learn from others' experiences.</td>

      <td>Exploring the ethical implications of open-source AI is a topic that deals with understanding the potential consequences of making AI systems and their underlying data and algorithms available to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the main ethical implications of using AI is that it can potentially lead to bias and discrimination, as the data and algorithms used to train these systems may reflect societal biases. Additionally, open data could also raise concerns about data privacy, as the release of sensitive data could lead to negative consequences for individuals and organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, open source AI can also be used to promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. Making the data and algorithms used to train AI systems publicly available, allows for greater oversight and monitoring of these systems to ensure that they are not being used in unethical or harmful ways. Additionally, open source AI can also foster community development and collaboration, allowing for transparency, a wider range of perspectives and expertise to be brought to bear on the development and use of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, open source AI has both potential benefits and drawbacks and it is important to consider the ethical implications before implementing it. Therefore, responsible AI governance and social responsibility are crucial.</td>

It entails two parts: 1) The collective exploration of astronomical images and space-based images of Earth (available from open access databases) with children, artists and people in a favela (slum) in Rio. Children will use space imagery to create poems, music, performances and street art together with local artists, to promote a positive and healthy vision of their environment. By exploring images with computers at the local cultural centre, they will practice digital skills while handling data containing information to observe the environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;2) The creation of a digital map of cultural projects in Rio favelas, including the new artwork and educational material, along with locations linked to the history and practice of astronomy in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project is informed by different aspects of the Open Science framework, from opening a dialogue with the community to creating science and educational material together. The interactive map, all content, lessons learnt and documentation on how to run similar initiatives will be released as open source projects.</td>

This is incredibly valuable information for researchers, but the data is trapped in tables, scattered across many different scientific papers. These papers are themselves often trapped behind journal pay-walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this project, I propose to; firstly, create a database of snake venom proteomics studies and secondly, create an online platform which will allow easy access to, and visualisation of, the proteins that have been identified in each snake venom.

      <td>Drilling fluid is a lubricant used in drilling oil and gas wells and in exploration rigs. It may vary with additives aimed at optimizing and improving the drilling process(Sadiq et al., 2003). They are mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds applied to cool and lubricate the drill bit; clean the borehole bottom; drive cuttings to the surface, control formation pressure and improve the function of the drill string and tools in the borehole (API, 1992).&nbsp;&nbsp; The decline of the environment is presently a common and overwhelming challenge globally (Gazali et al., 2017). Studies have shown that uncontrolled disposal of drilling fluid wastes, with accompanying toxic components contribute heavily to the diminishing biodiversity (Vincent-Akpu, 2015; Vincent-Akpu and Sikoki, 2013; Sil et al., 2012). Most drilling firms especially on-shore, prefer to use land spraying (or throwing) as a method of disposing the waste drilling muds. Such unsustainable methods could lead to some hostile environmental impacts (Gazali et al., 2017). Yet, if biodegradation is relied on as a natural and cost-effective option for pollutant breakdown and pollution control (Nrior et al., 2017).&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this study is to investigate the biodegradability of drilling fluid in the different soil types. This study, in addition to specifying the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil, will chiefly show which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability and by implication provide reliable data for policy makers as regards to environmental reclamation</td>

By harnessing density functional theory computations, this program automates the exploration of Kohn-Sham molecular orbitals (KS-MOs), offering invaluable insights into the fundamental driving forces behind the chemical bond formation and reactions. Our primary objective is to develop an intuitive tool that effortlessly generates and consolidates essential details, including orbital overlaps, energy gaps, orbital Gross Mulliken populations, and coefficients of fragment orbitals within the broader molecular orbitals. The PyOrb 1.0 program will address three major challenges associated with the analysis of MO bonding mechanisms: 1. It automatically identifies the dominant orbital interaction patterns. 2. It presents three different orbital interaction schemes corresponding to different stages of bond formation. 3. It constructs the orbital diagram including a final plot summarizing the key molecular orbitals. While we have already created an initial prototype, there are several enhancements required to enhance the usability of our tool. PyOrb 1.0 holds immense potential in simplifying the systematic analysis of atomic and molecular bonding mechanisms, allowing users to concentrate on advanced analysis tasks. We plan to make the PyOrb 1.0 source code openly accessible online, accompanied by an introductory tutorial, to facilitate easy retrieval and utilization.</td>

Molerhealth will provide individuals with a secure and user-friendly platform to access, update, and share their comprehensive health records, regardless of their location or healthcare provider. Through this comprehensive EHR system, patients will have seamless continuity of care, as their medical history, test results, medications,allergies and treatment plans will be readily available to healthcare professionals. By harnessing the power of technology, Molerhealth will significantly reduce the rate of misdiagnoses in Nigeria. Doctors will have access to a complete and up-to-date patient profile, enabling accurate diagnoses, appropriate treatment decisions, and timely referrals to specialists when necessary. Moreover, Molerhealth will facilitate better communication between healthcare providers by providing a platform for secure messaging and consultation, enabling the exchange of vital patient information. This collaboration will lead to more informed decision-making, increased efficiency, and ultimately, improved healthcare outcomes. Through its open-source nature, Molerhealth will encourage community participation, innovation, and customization, making it adaptable to the unique healthcare needs of different regions in Nigeria. It will serve as a catalyst for positive change, empowering individuals, and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem as a whole. Together, we will revolutionize healthcare in Nigeria with Molerhealth, ensuring accurate diagnoses, improved patient care, and a healthier future for all.</td>

To prevent voltage overloading, the grid power system must undergo rapid changes to maintain stability. The Swing equation is widely used for stability analysis, but its classical model may lead to erroneous conclusions. A modified Swing equation with forced oscillation and nonlinear damping is proposed, using the Lagrangian of the system derived from the maximum entropy principle. Statistical Mechanics preserves the Swing equation for power systems subjected to forced oscillations. The modified Swing equation is numerically integrated for various external load conditions, including constant, step, periodic, and stochastic loads. The steady state and transient stability of the system are determined by the load nature, magnitude, and damping.</td>

Our proposal is a tool that allows researchers to check whether their (fundamental) research is being cited by clinical trials. While traditionally only the number of citations has been used to establish impact of a publication, we aim to provide a more inclusive measure of societal impact by investigating the citation network. We will also explore ways to disseminate impact e.g. through visualisations.

      <td>The impostor phenomenon (IP) refers to self-doubts about one’s abilities and difficulty internalizing individual accomplishments. These individuals attribute their success to external (e.g., oversight or luck), instead of internal (e.g., intelligence or competence) factors. Therefore, they are worried that they will be found out as intellectual frauds or “impostors”. This phenomenon was first described by Clance and Imes in 1978 and received great attention over the last decades. Although initial researchers suggested that especially women suffer from the impostor phenomenon, more recent empirical evidence regarding gender differences is mixed. The aim of the current meta-analysis is to examine whether or not there are gender differences in the impostor phenomenon to examine where these potential gender differences come from moderation and mediation analysis. When conducting the meta-analysis, we want to follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis for Protocols (PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015) and use the PRISMA-P templates developed by Moreau and Gamble (2022). We will preregister our study by uploading these templates (e.g., hypotheses, article searching strategies, screening criteria, codebook) and share all study materials and data via the Open Science Framework. We will also keep a logbook to track all details of our project.</td>

While my ultimate vision is to serve the entire African continent, I plan to initiate this endeavor by focusing on South African languages. Accomplishing this goal will entail fostering a sense of community, engaging with educators including teachers, lecturers, and professors, as well as actively involving the general public to encourage content creation and course material publication. While platforms like MijnNederlands have been successfully established for specific languages like Dutch, to the best of my knowledge, no such platform currently exists for African languages. Building this platform will undoubtedly be an immense undertaking, but upon completion of this mentorship program, my aim is to have developed the website and initiated the process of community building.</td>

      <td>Gender is a deeply ingrained constructs in human culture and societies. It permeates our everyday activities, whether real or virtual, from social interactions to our digital lives. By nature, the most significant aspects of culture are reflected in scientific progress, determining its development and evolution. The way technological change is shaped and structured is thus inherently grounded in societal norms and relations, which are themselves equally affected by technological transformations. In this sense, the relationship among technology and gender can be considered as mutually constitutive. This relationship is leading to at least two main consequences: i) individuals increasingly encounter representations of gender embedded in technology; ii) machines are being trained to recognize and react to relevant traits of human identity, including gender. These consequences are made even more evident by the increasingly pervasive use of Automatic Face Analysis Systems (AFAS), especially when those systems are based on face recognition. However, these systems are consistently built on a gender binary construct and almost never take into account non-binary individuals, causing exclusion and reinforce existing prejudices about these communities. The project will break this barrier by analysing how algorithms (un)recognize non-binary faces, to foster the development of inclusive, diverse and trustworthy AI.</td>

Kang and colleagues (2018) state that metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells result in diverse metabolic dependent perturbations that may be targeted for cancer treatment. Generally, for instance, lipid metabolism powers the rapid growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (Cheng et al., 2016). Nonetheless, little is known about the functions of PEMT in tumor aggression, especially in GBM. Therefore, we hypothesize that PEMT contributes greatly to increased GBM invasion, proliferation and aggression capacities. Methods: To investigate the role of PEMT in GBM aggressiveness, we cloned the PEMT gene into U251 cell lines to overexpress the gene shRNA-mediated knockdown to silence the gene. Overexpression (OE) and knockdown (KD) were validated by microscopy, WB and RT-PCR. We conducted functional assays including, cell proliferation and cell viability. Subsequently, we confirmed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driving markers by RT-PCR and WB.</td>

      <td>Deux principales raisons m’incitent à travailler de manière ouverte et inclusive dans la recherche. D’abord, j’ai déjà eu par le passé l’impression que mes connaissances ou mes idées n’étaient pas suffisamment pris en compte. Depuis, j’essaie d’adopter des pratiques de travail exemplaires pour ne pas « infliger » la même impression à mes collègues. Ensuite, je suis tout à fait convaincu que travailler de manière ouverte et inclusive ouvre la voie à des réponses inattendues et à des solutions innovantes et légitimes, même si le processus peut parfois être long.</td>
