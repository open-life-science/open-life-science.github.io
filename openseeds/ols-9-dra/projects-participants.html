<p>As an EDI champion, my learning goals in open science are related to developing my understanding of equitable access to research resources and improving this access for equity-seeking groups. I want to support historically underrepresented individuals that lack access to specific technologies and resources in learning how to use alternative resources within their own work, in order to foster more openness and inclusivity in research. As such, I want to develop specialized strategies for removing barriers for underrepresented groups in science to benefit from open science resources, and I want to improve my ability to incorporate diverse perspectives in all stages of the research process.</p>

<p>As stated in my project proposal, I would like to learn more about data platforms and repositories used by researchers in Canada and worldwide. The Indigenous-led research center where I will be delivering workshops is located in a geographically isolated community. Hence, the most effective way for them to connect with the broader research community in Canada and worldwide is through digital platforms, which is why it is critically important that they learn about such platforms. I would also like to learn more about data management tools and software which can be used to organize and process data. For example, as part of the workshops, I would like to help the researchers write data management plans for their own research. Finally, although this is not specifically related to open science, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I will be learning R in the next couple of months. After discussing with members of the research center, we decided that the workshops should involve a brief introduction to programming using R. I am already quite familiar with Python, and have used it extensively as part of my research.</p>

<p>My learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of how open science practices can be integrated into mental health research, especially in ways that benefit equity-seeking groups. I also aim to refine my skills in using digital tools to ensure that the research outputs I contribute to are accessible and inclusive. By fostering a more collaborative and transparent research environment, I hope to set a precedent for future mental health studies.</p>

<p>My learning goals include developing strategies to seamlessly integrate open science practices into my research work, specifically by creating more inclusive training and outreach materials for FGS students. I hope to learn practical ways to engage students in open science discussions and to utilize open resources to enhance their research capabilities. Additionally, I want to explore effective ways to measure and communicate the value of open science practices to ensure continued support and expansion of these initiatives.</p>

  <li>To learn to more effectively create and disseminate tools that will encourage a much broader range of populations to join in on different stages of innovation, that are needed to stabilize our economy and civilization. Reaching beyond just purely academic circles to meaningfully bring into the fold non-academic innovators, enthusiast groups, and learners, and to do so around emerging technologies through dismantling the walls between disciplines in a conscientious fashion (not with a postmodern deconstructionist lens, but in grounded in objective, scientific, and functionally repeatable fashion, that yield a substantive increase in the volume and quality of innovations that can be commercialized).</li>
  <li>To learn to more effectively rally and interconnect industry and government entities in recognizing the need for, then the acceptance, funding, and incorporation of domain disrupting open source tools.</li>

<p>My personal learning goals related to open science include deepening my understanding of open data practices and the use of open-source software and tools to promote reproducible science. I aim to improve my skills with online collaboration platforms to facilitate interdisciplinary work and learn about altmetrics to better assess research impact beyond traditional metrics. Also, I want to explore interoperability and data standards for efficient data sharing, improve my abilities in open scientific communication, and understand funding and sustainability models for open projects. I’m also interested in learning about automation tools and workflow management to increase research efficiency, as well as learning how to identify and mitigate biases in research through effective data management strategies.</p>

        <p>My name is Sebastian and I am a PhD student in Neuroscience. I am currently attending Queen’s University in Kingston, ON. My research area focuses on traumatic brain injury and the resulting behavioural deficits that come with it. I have a particular emphasis on investigating how repeated asymptotic mild traumatic brain injury can accumulate into long-term cognitive &amp; motor impairment. We use different neuroimaging and sensorimotor data collection tools in our lab to see if we can associate changes in kinematics with changes in structural integrity. I’m very interested in sensorimotor control, and am hoping to do work in the motor recovery field later in my career.</p>

In my PhD studies, I am focused on microplastics as a factor impacting the freshwater microbiome. This includes evaluating the potential for microplastic to act as a vector for the spread of antimicrobial resistant pathogens, as well as exploring the potential of using bacteria as a tool for the remediation of plastic pollution.</p>

        <p>My name is Tiara, and I am a PhD candidate at Dalhousie University, specializing in biology. My research focuses on using Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study exercise-induced muscle damage and repair to unravel the intricate processes involved in muscle repair. Alongside my research, I am passionately committed to enhancing Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) within the scientific community by striving to create an inclusive environment that promotes diverse perspectives and equitable opportunities through outreach, advocacy, and science communication.</p>

        <p>I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at University of Toronto. My primary research focus is on developing a mobile application that leverages deep learning techniques to prevent slips and falls. My work aims to improve safety by assessing footwear slip resistance and environmental factors to reduce injury risks. In addition to my technical research, I am deeply committed to integrating principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) into my work. I strive to ensure that my research addresses the needs of diverse populations, particularly underrepresented groups, by designing accessible solutions that account for various cultural, socioeconomic, and physical differenc</p>
