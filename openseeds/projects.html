The initial goal would be to reach researchers from different institutions: UB, UPC, UPF, UOC, UAB, etc. and meet informally in a bar/pub periodically.<br>\nDuring the meetings we would present/talk about what we do, we will promote knowledge exchange and will discuss on how we could improve our research in terms of open science, for example performing more transparent research and sharing data/code. Later on, the plan is to use this community to create workshops and symposia about open science and to agree on some common needs. For example, a common need in life science research group would be to have resources to help researchers in terms of data sharing or interactive paper publication. If we can define common needs we will be able to apply for some funding to cover them.<br>\nWe will also use this plantform to motivate colleages from other parts of the country to create their own local community and then connect for some events.\n</td>

In its first year of life, the Office has identified relevant issues that seeks to pursue in order to support a collaborative climate of interdisciplinary research and discovery. Transparency is a key value of the Zuckerman Institute’s mission, and the Open Life Science mentor program is the perfect platform for me as the Assistant Director of Scientific Programs, to elaborate a strategy that will infuse open science best practices in the community. I hope that with the help of the cohort and the mentor, I can design a strategy to infuse a culture of open science within the community of researchers at the Zuckerman Institute. Ideally this would include power mapping, stakeholder mapping, action plans, and outreach. In the long run, work done in this project aims at developing community engagement for policy development, and will ultimately pave the way to establish the Zuckerman Institute as a golden standard for open science.\n</td>

<a href="https://pypi.org/project/plenpy/">plenoptic</a> is a Python package for computational vision with two main components: standard differentiable models of the visual system and synthesis methods. The models operate on images and make predictions about perception or neural activity, and are relatively simple, with a small number of parameters; they can thus be used out-of-the-box on arbitrary images. To start, we will focus on spatial vision, so the inputs are expected to be static grayscale images. Synthesis methods are used to better understand models of this type. The most common applications of computational models are simulation (holding the parameters and input constant, while predicting the output) and learning (holding the input and output constant, while fitting the parameters). In synthesis, the output and parameters are held constant while the input is fit. This allows scientists to develop better intuition about which aspects of images their models consider relevant and which they ignore, as well as to carry out more efficient and effective model comparison and validation experiments. We will include four such methods, all of which have been described in the literature, but none of which have standard, accessible implementations that work on more than a handful of specific models.\n</td>

<a href="https://intermine.org/">InterMine</a> is a powerful open source data warehouse system. It allows users to integrate diverse data sources with a minimum of effort, providing powerful web-services and an elegant web-application with minimal configuration. But InterMine warehouses are fragmented as there’re 30 InterMines which are not interconnected. Project BlueGenes aims to integrate all the sources and provide a single interface to access the data of all 30 InterMines.<br>\nThis project aims to develop a javascript based tool which will be embedded on BlueGenes list pages (which can be of genes or proteins). This tool will allow users to find similarities between different genes or proteins that are provided in the list. In order to enable this, we’ll make an explorable graph visualization of the relationships between InterMine entities (proteins or genes). Each entity or object will be represented as a node.<br>\nThe idea is that visualizing things helps us to spot patterns. So, we’ll have this tool, which will visualize the interactions and similarities between different entities and there will be options to tweak the appearance/structure to make things more explorable.\n</td>

I have been recruited as an Open Science Co-ordinator for Oxford Neuroscience, to work between departments and alongside partners in other institutions to develop policies and recommendations for good governance that work for individual facilities (e.g. WIN), across departmental boundaries within medical sciences (e.g. Oxford Neuroscience), and then beyond into the wider University and national networks. The aim is to develop an open science community through an understanding of the principles of behavior change, including recognizing scientific and individual risks and benefits for research participants, researchers (at all levels), and the institution.\n</td>

However, due to the scarcity of scientific evidence, the use of herbal medicines is limited to local wisdom. Several constraints such as the absence of funding, patent issues, and most importantly, the lack of modern scientific approaches have prevented the pathway to this gold mine of drug discovery. Here, we propose the development of AMRITA, an online web-based library of medicinal herbs that include their phylogeny, medicinal properties, known active components and related scientific literatures that is open publicly to the research community world-wide. This platform would facilitate the collaboration of researchers across the fields of biological, pharmaceutical, and clinical sciences in establishing a solid foundation of medicinal plants and enabling the use of these plants in modern medicine.\n</td>

More importantly, I would like to design an efficient communication strategy to bring this relevant content to young PIs in a way that saves them time and energy. This would first require understanding what PIs most needed when they started (and therefore which already existing resources are actually useful), and how it should be delivered to them - in which form, through which channels (e.g. young PIs newsletter), at what time(s). Then, I would like to curate existing content, repackage it in an easily accessible and “digestable” form, add to it, but also create readily usable tools (e.g. templates - not just things people have to read). Topics would include how to work openly and inclusively (e.g. lab codes of conduct, lab manuals, leading inclusive meetings, setting up a healthy lab culture etc.); how to do research open (preprints, toolkits with software to work open, project management tools etc.); how to train the next generation of open scientists; and how to open your work to the public. Finally, I would like to approach organisations and institutions to help more young PIs get access to these resources.\n</td>

Bioimage informatics was the first larger extension of EDAM beyond mainstream bioinformatics and computational biology, with highly successful development model engaging a broad community of bioimaging and bioimage analysis experts. The <a href="">EDAM-bioimaging</a>\n work was initiated by Jon Ison, Josh Moore, and others, and I have been\nresponsible for its further coordination.<br>\nEDAM is used in applications such as registries of computational tools or training materials (contributing to open science), in the Common Workflow Language (<a href="https://www.commonwl.org/">CWL</a>), or in automated workflow composition. It is also in the process of implementation in various parts of the <a href="https://galaxyproject.org/">Galaxy project</a>. EDAM is developed in a transparent and participatory manner, similar to modern open source software (it is available under CC BY-SA).<br>\nThe goal of this concrete mentorship project is to further extend EDAM, so that other communities can benefit from it, and from the applications and use cases it fosters.\n</td>

      <td>We recently received some funding from our university to host a workshop\nabout 3D modeling methods for biomechanics. This sparked the idea of creating\nsome sort of online database of workflows in our field. This website will\nserve early career researchers or researchers starting out with biomechanical\nanalyses, or those wishing to switch their workflows (for example to be more\nfreeware based). Currently there is a need for a central repository of such\nworkflows. Usually they are only circulated within lab groups or between\ncollaborators. However, an online hub with modeling resources would\nsignificantly reduce the time researchers need to invest in choosing\nprograms and figuring out how to set up their models, giving them more\ntime to do research and develop new methods. For this project, we\nspecifically want to build a website with open source workflows, tips and\ntricks for setting up models for finite element analysis, as well as other\n3D workflows (such as fossil reconstruction in freeware programs).\n</td>

Students in this field often learn\nhard skills in open science at weekend workshops, summer schools, and\nhackathons, but there is a gap in the learning experience regarding\nlong-term support. The main measurable outcome of this project would be\nhaving a group of senior trainees who take turns hosting Open-Science\noffice hours at regular intervals throughout the year. These meetings\nwould take place virtually and/or in person in Montreal, Canada (depending\non COVID-19).\nAlthough we hope to spark this initiative, it would need community support\nto be sustainable. In the first stage, I would welcome collaborators to\nhelp plan. Later, we would need support in the form of funding so that we\ncan compensate TA’s; this would help enable less-privileged trainees to get\ninvolved as TA’s. Finally, we would need to recruit the TA’s. Thus, this\nproject will involve community contributions at all stages, in various capacities.\n</td>

      <td>In this new project I aim to explore the specific challenges (both\npractical and metascience related) to adoption of registered reports in\nprimate neurophysiology. As far as we aware there has not yet been a\nregistered report within the field of non-human-primate (NHP)\nneurophysiology. There are specific challenges for using this format\nwithin this field; some practical and some metascientific. A central issue\nis that the existing format for registered reports focuses on hypothesis\ntesting, whereas neurophysiology is quite often an exploratory and\niterative process. Working with NHPs is a necessarily limited privilege\nand comes with considerable responsibility; the cost of having experiments\nwhere the results are not robust, or where opportunities for discovery\nare missed, is particularly high, since opportunity for replication is\nlimited. Therefore, peer review in advance of performing an experiment\nseems a particularly valuable idea. This project would explore ways in\nwhich to find compromise in the conflict between existing registered\nreport formats and current methodologies in primate neurophysiology.\n</td>

      <td>The Design for Retrofit project I work on at The Alan Turing Institute,\nwithin the Data-Centric Engineering programme aims to use data-driven methods\nto address uncertainty in design stage decision-making towards reducing the\ncarbon impact of homes through retrofit. This involves quantification of the\ncurrent energy demand of housing archetypes and physics-based modelling to\nevaluate the impact of energy-efficiency technologies available to be installed\nin the home during the retrofit process. However, uncertainty exists due to a\nlack of monitored data on indoor air temperature, which leads to a performance\ngap between modelled and monitored energy demand as heating practices are the\nmost sensitive parameter within building energy modelling. Further uncertainty\nis acknowledged due to a lack of longitudinal data following retrofit. Such\ndata could inform the evaluation of long-term impacts of technologies installed,\nto inform future decision making. Motivated householders who are planning or\nrecently completed a retrofit project might be interested to share data, perhaps\nin return for research insight on the impacts and success of similar projects\nthrough a citizen science approach.

      <td>Citizen science revolves around the idea of integrating the public in scientific research. However, there are different interpretations of this idea. An important part of citizen science projects allows laymen only to participate in a limited scope of microtasks and keeps thus reinforcing the power gap between academic scientists and the public. Literature has called for more autonomy of citizen scientists by allowing them to participate in more phases of the research cycle. Commons-based peer-production, an alternative mode of production in which people self-organize to develop complex knowledge-commons like Wikipedia or open software, seems to be a promising approach to facilitate this. However, a design-centred approach implementing this for a specific use case is yet to be done. In my PhD project I am trying to fill this gap by redesigning the online ecosystem of Open Humans - an existing community of practice around citizen science - collaborating closely with this community in a user-centered design approach. As one of the first steps, I am working on a best practices guide, summarizing the experiences of existing similar projects.</td>

Importantly, metrics derived from actigraphy are being increasingly used in clinical contexts, where groups of psychiatric and neurological patients in specific conditions have found to be exhibit abnormal rest-activity rhythms and sleep. Sleep and circadian parameters from actigraphy are derived measures. These are obtained by converting the movements counts (usually obtained at a resolution of 1 minutes) into sleep parameters and circadian metrics using  algorithms raging from threshold-based computations to machine learning techniques. Unfortunately, at present, there are no standards or schemas for specifying and sharing actigraphy data and corresponding algorithms.\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a common schema for the use, analysis, reporting and open and interoperable sharing of actigraphy data across different actigraphy devices produced by different commercial manufacturers and for use by researchers and research users.

      <td>BioFerm is a web application platform which can be used for kinetic study, simulation and optimization of bioprocesses. The user is able to calculate the best initial conditions as well as overall operating conditions which will result in the highest product yield (or any user specified output). Kinetic modelling can also be done to further analyse the process and to calculate and estimate yield and kinetic parameters respectively. This allows the prediction of substrate, product and biomass concentrations over the bioprocess period. The BioFerm web application will be able to take in a variety of bioreactor configurations (batch, fed batch, continuous) and  fit the results to a variety of models(inhibition and non-inhibition) to return the above mentioned parameters. The software is currently being written in Python using an open-source app framework(streamlit) to run the app but will later be written using Django, also a popular web framework.</td>

Although its main limitation resides on their short read-length that has been suppressed by long-read/real-time sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore MinION. Currently, there are many standalone tools/algorithms to process this data inclusive bioinformatic pipelines but they lack a better integration. My proposal is the development of a modular python pipeline for nanopore metabarcoding data - metaNanoPype - with the following modules: (I) demultiplexing; (II) quality-assessment; (III) quality-filtering and trimming; (IV) taxonomic classification; (V) diversity analyses. Each module could include several options to allow flexibility. Each step could generate a log file used later to build a report in html/pdf format describing the versions, commands and references of software used. The report built would ensure reproducibility, transparency, acknowledgement and could be used as supplementary material of papers. metaNanoPype could be publicly available on github (open source) with further documentation published with github pages.</td>

The goal of this project is to improve sktime’s online documentation with a specific focus on documenting algorithm contributors. Algorithms form a major part of sktime. They require special expertise in their development and maintenance. We plan to enhance the existing documentation by making algorithm contributors more visible. The aim is (i) to make it easier for users and other developers to directly get in touch with the algorithm experts to ask questions or suggest code improvements and (ii) to recognize their contributions more visibly and formally to encourage long-term maintenance of their contributions. sktime has already defined a new community role as part of their governance guidelines to ensure that algorithm contributors have extra rights and responsibilities with regard to their algorithm. However, up-to-date documentation listing the current contributors and links to their algorithms is currently missing. Optionally, we can add other information like literature references. We plan to automate the generation of this documentation by making use of the existing documentation and other components such as CODEOWNERS file and <strong>author</strong> strings in Python files.</td>

However, the standardisation of phytolith research and data publication is still far from being achieved. Moreover, a recent assessment of the data sharing practices within the phytolith community found only half of the publications share some form of data and the majority do not provide reusable data. This project has grown from initial efforts by Emma Karoune during OLS2 to raise awareness of issues with poor data sharing practice. It is part of a broader initiative supported by the International Phytolith Society on data sharing and represents the first steps towards the FAIRification of phytolith data: an evaluation of sharing practices in phytolith research; the creation of a GitHub repository for collaborative use by this working group and in the forthcoming FAIRification project; and the development of a webpage to provide the community with information as the project proceeds.</td>

Obesity is an outcome of complex, heritable, and multi-factorial interaction of multiple genes, environmental factors, and behavioral traits that makes management and prevention challenging in the human population (Rao et al., 2014). Experimental research has demonstrated that altered metabolites in multiple metabolic pathways are associated with obesity (Zhao et al.,2016). Alteration in the proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes in the gut microbiome can trigger obesity. The gut microbiome’s influence on obesity is much more complicated than the imbalance of these bacteria species. Modulation of the gut microbiome through diet, prebiotics, surgery, and antibiotics significantly affects the obesity epidemic (John &amp; Mullin, 2016). It is one of the enormous global health problems associated with increased morbidity and mortality mediated by its association with several other metabolic disorders (Saini et al., 2018). We aim to target obesity and diabetes-associated metabolic disorders and annotate the genes common to these complex diseases using a systems genomic integrated approach, thereby using Galaxy as a platform.</td>

While we are committed to open practices at CONABIO and all collected data are open, some external contributors lack the skills to use these data, even if they have helped collect them, and are not familiar with open practices. Thus my project consists in developing training materials (OER) for an introductory workshop on open data with a focus on FAIR principles, biodiversity standards, effective management strategies, among other skills that encourage contributors to become active users of data apart from collectors. The integration of social and biological information and the use of Indigenous data are distinctive features of agrobiodiversity research in Mexico that will also be addressed. I expect this serves as a prototype for advanced training modules that could be used by future contributors or other researchers working on agrobiodiversity topics.</td>

Ten thousand tweets will be extracted per language via the Twitter API. Thereafter, the tweets will be annotated by native annotators for each of the languages. These annotators will be hired and trained to perform the annotation. The annotation tasks consist of labeling each tweet as either positive, negative or neutral.To mitigate errors and bias, each dataset will be annotated by three different annotators. After which the project team will compute the kappa agreement between the annotators\n \n Nigerian Sentiment Lexicon: In the same way, manual annotation of the tweets will be used to create the sentiment lexicon for each of the three languages. The sentiment lexicon annotation task involves Identifying sentiment bearing words from each tweet and assigning a sentiment score between +1 to +5 (with 1 being the most negative sentiment and +5 the most positive sentiment).\n \n Nigerian Hate Speech Lexicon: Extreme negative sentiment from the sentiment lexicon will be used to develop the hate speech lexicon. \n \n Annotation tool: We plan to use a web-based annotation tool, brat (Stenetorp et al., 2012) which has been proved to be efficient for this type of task by many researchers. The annotators must be native speakers of the language and follow the annotation guidelines provided by the project teams. \n \n HausaNLP aims to create more language resources that can be used to train models in machine learning.</td>

Robust AI models are developed, based on novel ensemble learning methodologies, leading to vendor-specific and -neutral AI models for addressing 8 PCa clinical scenarios. To accelerate the clinical translation of PCa AI models, we focus on improving the trust of the solutions with respect to fairness, safety, explainability, and reproducibility. A roadmap for AI models certification is defined, interacting with regulatory authorities, thus contributing to a European regulatory roadmap for validating the effectiveness of AI-based models for clinical decision making.</td>

The ambassadors will identify potential OS activities that can be kickstarted, give solutions to questions raised and advice on best practices on their institutions.\n \n At the end of this project: a network will be created, together with a framework to maintain this group active, and ambassadors will disseminate the knowledge gathered about application of OS principles in health research in their institutes. That would allow the progressive implementation of OS in HRI.</td>

As MAFIL is “open access” laboratory, i.e. provides researchers outside of CEITEC access to the laboratories, technologies, and experts of CEITEC to conduct their analysis and support their research needs, the procedures will be document and training provided to MAFIL users (“customers”) to be aware of FAIRification procedures and able to apply them on their data making them “EOSC ready”. The outputs and experiences will also be shared with other labs/nodes within Czech-BioImaging/Euro-BioImaging infrastructures.\n Thus, we would very appreciate and welcome any training, help, advice, or good practise on FAIRification and anonymisation of neuroimaging datasets.</td>

I will build upon the Open Source community health metric (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health), which involves evaluating contributors’ group that is actively involved in a project, number of new contributors that join the project, and members who leave. For online projects, it can also involve tracking the number of community ambassadors, the number of return attendees to events and the rate of churned attendees. Developing an ideal metric in this project will require further deliberation and consultation from The Turing Way team and core contributors. Hence, this project will be collaboratively designed with other community members by actively inviting their contributions and thoughts.</td>

Reproducible research is necessary to ensure that scientific output can be trusted and built upon. Despite this importance, many studies are difficult to reproduce, including those involving the application of a computational model.\n \n To overcome this “Reproducibility Crisis” we need to identify and standardized reproducible practices that researchers can apply in their projects from the start. But these may vary across fields and methods. In this context, this project will quantitatively assess and derive those research practices that can ensure the reproducibility of studies involving the development and application of AI models for understanding cognitive-systems, with the overarching goal of increasing their transparency and trustworthiness. \n \n As a cognitive neuroscientist, I will develop a prototype of this assessment by identifying and openly documenting reproducible practices of computational modelling projects in my field. With my participation in OLS-3, I will review the reproducible practices of gold-standard studies and assess the level of transparency maintained in their research. I will also curate relevant guidelines and expert-recommendations. The findings will be collaboratively reported as chapters in The Turing Way.</td>

Furthermore, this microscope makes use of a new detection system based on transmitted electrons and scintillation photons, which provides comparable information to conventional detection methods. To make use of the full potential of this microscope, new methods for data management, data analysis and visualization have to be designed. For example, we would like to employ deep learning methods for automatic segmentation.

Metagenomics of NPs is an innovative approach that utilizes next-generation sequencing to study microorganisms via the analysis of their DNA acquired directly from an environmental sample. The screening of natural product extracts has traditionally been the most effective method for identifying new compounds with unique cellular targets which are potentially useful as lead structures for the development of new therapeutics. \n\nHowever, there is hardly any known project which utilises Citizen Science in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we are collaborating with Open Science community Saudi Arabia (OSASA) to adapt this approach in our current project.

      <td>I aim to develop a Python library which allows to call and apply several measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated data, and provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures. &amp;nbsp;\n\nMeasures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e., parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two). &amp;nbsp;\n\nQuantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite substantially in the last couple of decades,  quantifying emergence is completely new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf, or https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289), but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), programming languages (including Matlab which is not open source). &amp;nbsp;\n\nA way to easily use &amp; compare a set of state of the art emergence and complexity measures by using a few lines of code is thus missing – this is the gap that I’d  like to fill.</td>

However, currently it is orientated towards issues encountered mostly in Data Science, and while many of the resources are extendable towards other fields, I consider that it could benefit from specific chapters focused on different research areas. The aim of this project is to create such a chapter by understanding the exact barriers for young researchers when considering reproducible research in Decision Sciences. The guide would be instead of a collection of resources that can be simply used at the end to make “your research more reproducible”, a way of thinking in a way and contain resources that help you consider reproducibility towards the entire research.</td>

Therefore, by analyzing OLS participant’s survey data, we could gain insight into the demography and socio-culture of the participants. In this way, both OLS team will get a chance to enhance their program for the future and I will learn how to perform data analysis, deal with the survey data and gain some programming skills as well.

All these looking towards European community goals, as usual.\n\nDuring the 2nd edition in 2021, we swim into Lithuania’s waters, to dive deep – finally live! – into water challenges in the next country in the Baltic region. We will get to know best practices of good water management, experience with transboundary river cooperation, also innovations and developments within sewerage system management. We can already read about flood risk management and about river barriers to remove or mitigate in the Baltic Sea Region (https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_flood-risk-management-in-the-baltic-sea-region_2021.pdf, https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_report_dam_removal_april_2021.pdf). This time we ask – how are the Lithuanian rivers?\nBeing a visitor of the largest protected area in Lithuania, crossing rivers outdoor, stepping into practical lectures in the national park, we will also ask about how to limit riverine pollution from tourism and how the connectivity of amazing Lithuanian rivers is ensured.\nChecking the European background: how the situation of rivers in Europe looks like in general? Later in time, I may widen it to Europe, not only the Baltic region.\n\nRiver University has been granted patronage from European Parliament and I seek and encourage water-related institution patronage at every edition. It engages top-level lecturers and universities and practitioners, e.g.: the University of Lausanne, Warsaw University of Life\nSciences, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries.</td>

The goal is to popularise and raise local researchers’ awareness of open science practices and platforms and thus to tackle the existing structural barriers (e.g., linguistic, epistemic, etc.) in accessing the information and disseminating the research from Central Asia. Currently, the local scholarship is located - geographically, linguistically, epistemically - in the global periphery which hinders the knowledge production, use, and dissemination in the region. Many scholars, as the result, become trapped in fraudulent research and publication practices. Moreover, there are cases when openly accessible educational resources are offered to researchers as a marketable product. So, to address these and other issues related to inaccessibility of knowledge production infrastructure, this project aims to create an openly accessible, fair, and multilingual educational resource about open science with the particular focus on Central Asia.

The linked information should allow complex questions to be asked, including: how similar models differ; which datasets can be repurposed to test different model outputs; and identifying   whether and how different models can be composed together. This will promote open scientific practices in this research area (through the use of common metadata standards and terms), and may serve as a valuable framework for collaborative knowledge capture and exploration.</td>

      <td>I would like to work with the Skills Team at the Alan Turing institute in order to create a peer-mentoring training programme from the main topics of The Turing Way. Our aim is to turn the five main areas in The Turing Way, namely research reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics into modules which the participants of the peer-mentoring programme can work on together. They would apply it on their own research/ projects, therefore they could put the learnt knowledge in use immediately. The aim of The Turing Way has been to be an open source, collaborative, applicable, and practical tool, and with this programme we would like to facilitate the use of it. We would like to see how people in their different stages of their career (PhD, Post-Doc, Researcher, Admin) can collaborate to deepen their knowledge about the contents of The Turing Way, while understand each other’s perspective on the subject. If the prototype is successful, we would like open it up for any applicants interested in applying the practices of The Turing Way to their own projects as part of the other trainings offered by the Institute.</td>

Homogeneous catalysts are important in many of our daily processes, but also in our fight against climate change. Our goal was to create a tool that can automatically generate large datasets that can be used in research for data-driven catalyst discovery.\n\nThe issue was that a simple SMILES representation of a molecular scaffold does not work when it contains a transition metal complex. With this tool we use the 3D coordinates of a molecular scaffold and let the user place molecular fragments to create many variations of this scaffold. Other inorganic chemistry fields that use transition-metal containing molecules might benefit from this tool as well. A first prototype is published, but several things can be done to increase the usability of our tool.</td>

With this project, we aim to open the Hub to the whole computer science community, encouraging third-author model depositions so that the code they develop is not simply open source but also deployed in a user-friendly manner. By leveraging the Hub architecture, computer scientists can reach more users, interact with them and further the impact of the assets they have developed by facilitating its implementation in real case scenarios. To this end, the project will focus on establishing clear guidelines on the quality of the software and its reproducibility (as it won’t necessarily be yet peer-reviewed) and creating a standard model deposition form and minimum required documentation. The ultimate goal of the project is to build a community of contributors by facilitating their access.</td>

Unfortunately, a large percentage of our country has a very poor level of education, often not being able to read or speak English very well. Most South African resources I have found for individuals with, and parents of children with, autism are only available in English. My project aims to create a database of resources in a variety of South African languages, both written and as a video format (due to poor literacy rates, especially among older generations due to historical discrimination), in easy to understand language and with concepts that are easy to grasp. This is also useful as more people will be able to access online resources than resources at a healthcare facility.</td>

      <td>As open science projects mature, they attract, engage and retain members who actively participate and contribute to the project. They build <em>Communities of Practice</em> around the project through knowledge exchange, maintenance or development practices and ultimately guide the future directions for both the projects and their communities. To build a more equitable, resilient and sustainable open infrastructure for a diverse community, it is important to select governance models that give voices to people (users, contributors and wider society) from different socio-technical and socio-cultural backgrounds, identities, career stages, contextual needs and   research communities.  The Turing Way is a guide for reproducible, ethical and collaborative research and data science. Open Life Science is a training and mentoring program to help researchers learn and apply open principles in their work. They are mission-aligned open science projects that involve participants from around the world to create something deeply meaningful for them. The Turing Way has grown exponentially in the last three years that offers more than 200 pages co-created by more than 300 contributors. Open Life Science has offered 4 cohorts in the last 2 years and currently supports a community of over 300 members (present and past mentees, mentors and experts).  To support the governance work in these projects in 2022, I would like to carry out a systematic study of governance models suitable for decentralised and distributed communities such as these. By creating a portfolio of governance models suitable for projects at different maturity levels, members from these projects will be able to identify the right model for their respective  projects. The aim is to establish norms, workflows and processes that ensure a  democratic structure for decision-making and leadership in a way that contributes to projects’ own visions while collaborating on the shared mission for global open science.</td>

      <td>Open Science for Improve diagnostics of Cancer through Artificial Intelligence and Digital Pathology.\n\nCancer is becoming increasingly prevalent among the group of treatable diseases in African countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 10% of histopathology needs are met and this is a major barrier to comprehensive management of cancers\n\n1. There is a shortage of clinicians and pathologists available for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the critical factors in treatment efficiency is the correct and timely diagnosis of specimens by pathologists. However, there is currently a significant shortage of cancer care clinicians in Africa and an even more considerable shortage of pathologists. In Cameroon, there are 19 pathologists currently in practice for 22,179,707 inhabitants\n2. The absolute number of patients with cancer in Cameroon was estimated to be 25,000 cases a year.\n\nDiagnosis of cancer relies on histology in nearly 80% of cases, cytology in 10%, and clinical diagnosis in 10% (1). There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop a rapid, highly sensitive and diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of   cancers, to increase cancer treatment efficacy and reduce overtreatment of tumors clinically suspicious for malignancy.   We propose a hybrid diagnosis method with a deep Learning algorithm applied on hematoxylin and eosin histology slides. Digital microscopy and telepathology were already successfully used to mitigate the lack of pathologists in Cameroon, thus confirming the availability of a robust dataset for our project (1). Following splitting into training, validation and test sets, we will use CNNs as algorithms on the collected images to train the algorithm before deployment and tests. In addition to automated diagnostic, the developed program will have specific features such as sample information storage and tracking software as well as image optimization and analysis tools.\n1.

ARPHAI pilots data-driven open source tools using artificial intelligence and data science towards upgrading Argentina’s electronic health record (EHR) system. ARPHAI is part of the <a href="https://covidsouth.ai/">Global South AI4COVID Program</a>.\n\nARPHAI includes persons from 20  institutions. ARPHAI started in October 2020 and has grown very fast from scratch. More specifically, ARPHAI is piloting three EHR-based components in parallel to anticipate and detect potential epidemic outbreaks\n1. The extraction of computable phenotypes of diseases, symptoms, and syndromes using natural language processing to analyze EHR structured and free-text;\n2. Models for understanding and prediction of relevant epidemiological variables using computable phenotypes and open data information as input; and\n3. Dashboard visualization of the results from both points above, along with additional open data sources to inform decisions made by the public sector epidemiological authorities.\n\nThere are two additional lines of work ARPHAI undertakes that are transversal to these three research developments, which include a) diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) with a focus on gender and b) responsible use of health data.</td>

We use data from current experimental projects and develop new models to aid the growth of astrobiology search for life. The platform will cater to multiple sections such as- data management from all astrobiology projects, experiments, research labs and conferences; new tools to analyse data, predictive model section to simulations from the data set and collaborative forum to encourage citizen science.The platform will help create open source bioinformatic tools to help detect biosignature, assess habitability, promote involvement within  astrobiology. In addition to using bioinformatic tools, a part of the platform will use game theory and gamification to test the citizen science component. Using both the platform as a destination for tool testing and science education, we hope to advance the research in astrobiology.</td>

The teaching materials will be composed of several modules, each including short presentation on key topics, reading, quizzes, and hands-on activities, and a mini-project. For the latter, we will apply Data Science techniques to investigate science itself, specifically a corpus of scientific literature (Big Data, accessed via free Dimensions accounts). Students will plan and conduct meta-science projects on chosen topics. In other exercises, students will track the life cycle of a scientific publication and get into the shoes of one of the researchers. We will explore some of the fundamental issues that modern science and scientists face, including incentives, fraud, questionable research practices and biases, and how science intersects with the broader society and policy. Overall, this course will deepen students understanding of science as a collective activity and a complex system with many players - helping young people to navigate their career in research and develop critical skills for other career paths.</td>

By creating a semantic overview of the interaction between skills, technologies and the key role-players in the RSE community, this ontology will be able to provide information on the research fields that each RSE has background knowledge in, their development skills, and the services that they are willing to provide clients, enabling a way in which suitable RSEs can be assigned to projects where they will be able to provide software development and software-development-related assistance. This project also aligns with the thinking supported by Open Science, as the ontology is aimed to be reusable and reproducible.</td>

At the hackathon, participants can either come up with their own problem statements or chose one to work on from our list. The questions will focus on: (1) difficulties that prevent them from fully implementing and practicing some or all aspects of OS in their science networks/ institutions/universities, and (2) problems that can be solved through OS. OILS will provide support to the participants by tapping into the OS  network in Switzerland and introducing them to necessary experts and tools. An example of such a problem could be the absence of a searchable data repository in their university that contains links to all published datasets from the participating research groups - such an infrastructure would encourage the generation and sharing of well-annotated data. At the end of the event, ideally, the participants would have actionable steps and solutions that either can be directly implemented by them or proposed to competent authorities.

To accomplish this, the idea needs at least two moderators to approve the material uploaded, an curator to organize the site, and a digger to find links and people that wants to upload their material.</td>

I would like to outline a plan for performing this stakeholder engagement openly via the GitHub repository, leading to collaboratively-generated user requirements for the final products. I will consider how to reach stakeholders and engage them in open discussion on GitHub, and how to organise that work to generate a mutually agreed-upon set of user requirements. Stakeholders will include scientists such as polar researchers and AI researchers, who will contribute to requirements for the forecasting capabilities, as well as additional end-users such as conservation researchers and indigenous communities, who will help shape software requirements.</td>

Working environment: can we extend personal knowlege management software to reference biodiversity-relevant data classes (in a similar way to how bibliographic citations are managed)         - We have developed a set of Obsidian plugins which facilitate easy access to the data resources needed to (a) work with existing species descriptions from literature and (b) recognise and formally describe new species.

      <td>Ages fraud scandals have tarnished African sport at the international level. In 2009, FIFA adopted MRI as an age determination tool for its youth level competitions but recent studies show that bone age assessment has a very large margin of error and cannot be a standard for determining apparent age when we know that environmental factors greatly influence the development of the child. There are populations in which the disappearance of growth cartilage is 4 to 5 years earlier than in another. The ugly face of the problem is that many children are born out of the healthcare system.  In Cameroon, approximately 1.7 million children, or 66 %, do not have a birth certificate. These children are said to be “invisible” In other words, they live without being recognised by the country whose citizenship they claim.  According to a study carried out by Unicef, 40,000 children, in the Far North region alone, will find it difficult to present their end of year First School Leaving Certificate (FSLC) for lack of a birth certificate. To establish these birth certificates, it will be necessary to make an estimate of their apparent age in a complex process which discourages parents. It is evident that the determination of apparent age should not only be seen from a clinical standpoint. Instead, socio-cultural and environment factors must also be taken into account. To remedy this situation which has reached the alert level, it is urgent to propose a simplified and open system for determining Apparent Age to turn invisible kids to visible ones based on available Data and Machine Learning techniques.</td>

      <td>Open Data (OD) plays a crucial role in openly sharing scientific knowledge with a worldwide audience (among both academic and non-academic audiences) and encouraging reproducibility. But OD is much less developed in Humanities and Social Science (HSS) research, primarily because of the levels of sensitivity of the data involved, and consent required from participants, which could be difficult for researchers, especially if they are new to data sharing. With the growing interest in computing, researchers working in Computational Social Science (CSS) face similar issues when working with social data in their research, while conforming to legal and ethical restrictions. As per OD guidelines, data must comply with the FAIR principles. But the metrics offered by various OD repositories and publication platforms could be different, which limits the affordances of social activity and the type of OD published.   To embrace Open Science projects among HSS and CSS researchers who are working or looking to work with sensitive data, this project proposes a platform (or hub) to promote free, online resources for both professionals and students looking to learn about science and ethics. Here, they can also contribute to discussions related to the topic, post questions, and learn from others’ experiences.</td>

      <td>Exploring the ethical implications of open-source AI is a topic that deals with understanding the potential consequences of making AI systems and their underlying data and algorithms available to the public.   One of the main ethical implications of using AI is that it can potentially lead to bias and discrimination, as the data and algorithms used to train these systems may reflect societal biases. Additionally, open data could also raise concerns about data privacy, as the release of sensitive data could lead to negative consequences for individuals and organizations.  However, open source AI can also be used to promote transparency and accountability in AI systems. Making the data and algorithms used to train AI systems publicly available, allows for greater oversight and monitoring of these systems to ensure that they are not being used in unethical or harmful ways. Additionally, open source AI can also foster community development and collaboration, allowing for transparency, a wider range of perspectives and expertise to be brought to bear on the development and use of AI.  In summary, open source AI has both potential benefits and drawbacks and it is important to consider the ethical implications before implementing it. Therefore, responsible AI governance and social responsibility are crucial.</td>

As a first step in achieving this aim and an effective pilot of the discussion points, we have recently hosted our first round of focus groups where we addressed the following topics: * Who are we not seeing at conferences, and what would it actually take to get them there? * Implementation of considerations for constantly changing and sensitive geopolitical issues? * Support for visas and other regulatory considerations  * Enforcement of harassment policies and embedding of harassment prevention methods at the earliest planning stages  Through this endeavour, we connected with interesting and passionate people. We set up a mailing list where we share regular updates on the ongoing work, and excitingly, we have a list of people potentially interested in collaborating on this project. We hope to draw on their perspectives and experiences in developing a publication and any other potential outputs that will help incite real, tangible change in the space of academic events.</td>

      <td>For an AI framework with a queer perspective from the Majority World that is going to be used by technologists, final users, policymakers, sociologists, activists, and everyone involved with Artificial Intelligence, we must consider using a common language in all stages of the foundation of any AI: design, development, deployment, and detection of biases. Furthermore, this common language should go around the concepts of fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics because of actions those could bring in setting the AI foundation and making them less harmful for queer people from the Majority World.   This is going to demand that all of us involved in this process think outside the box and bring queer, Majority World theories, methods, and methodologies, also the use of MLP, NLP, neurosciences, and trans theories from the majority world, body theories, cultural studies as a methodology, interviews, focus groups, participatory design, documentary, or case analysis, field research, law-making, regulatory processes, and others, altogether creating this framework.   It is understandable, needs to include the language that can transform this specific harmful stereotype into regulations, formal definitions, and actions that can benefit not only queer people but all of us.</td>

The user then keys in the word artificial intelligence and the system gives a detailed guide of all that is required of the field such as academic qualifications needed/natural skills needed too. The program also includes various study programs, schools, scholarships etc, differentiating if it is remote, onsite and hybrid taking note of the locations of the available programs. Each program will also have fees allocation and other details provided by the dataset fed into the system. Statistics such as average salary, working hours etc will also be provided, and related fields as well, which if a user clicks, it will redirect to the clicked field.  The bottom up approach uses qualifications be it academic or natural to direct an individual towards available careers for that qualification. Say a student just had the Advanced level passing Biology, chemistry, computer science and maths. The system will also prompt the student to give in natural qualifications such as great organizational skills, working alone or in team, interpersonal skills etc, from which a roadmap to the various available careers based on those qualifications will be given as a guide for the student to follow. Other information such as scholarship opportuinities, internships, schools, programmes etc will be given in the system as well.

It entails two parts: 1) The collective exploration of astronomical images and space-based images of Earth (available from open access databases) with children, artists and people in a favela (slum) in Rio. Children will use space imagery to create poems, music, performances and street art together with local artists, to promote a positive and healthy vision of their environment. By exploring images with computers at the local cultural centre, they will practice digital skills while handling data containing information to observe the environment.  2) The creation of a digital map of cultural projects in Rio favelas, including the new artwork and educational material, along with locations linked to the history and practice of astronomy in the city.   The project is informed by different aspects of the Open Science framework, from opening a dialogue with the community to creating science and educational material together. The interactive map, all content, lessons learnt and documentation on how to run similar initiatives will be released as open source projects.</td>

This is incredibly valuable information for researchers, but the data is trapped in tables, scattered across many different scientific papers. These papers are themselves often trapped behind journal pay-walls.  In this project, I propose to; firstly, create a database of snake venom proteomics studies and secondly, create an online platform which will allow easy access to, and visualisation of, the proteins that have been identified in each snake venom.

      <td>Wapouo Fadanka Stephane</td>
      <td>Drilling fluid is a lubricant used in drilling oil and gas wells and in exploration rigs. It may vary with additives aimed at optimizing and improving the drilling process(Sadiq et al., 2003). They are mixture of natural and synthetic chemical compounds applied to cool and lubricate the drill bit; clean the borehole bottom; drive cuttings to the surface, control formation pressure and improve the function of the drill string and tools in the borehole (API, 1992).   The decline of the environment is presently a common and overwhelming challenge globally (Gazali et al., 2017). Studies have shown that uncontrolled disposal of drilling fluid wastes, with accompanying toxic components contribute heavily to the diminishing biodiversity (Vincent-Akpu, 2015; Vincent-Akpu and Sikoki, 2013; Sil et al., 2012). Most drilling firms especially on-shore, prefer to use land spraying (or throwing) as a method of disposing the waste drilling muds. Such unsustainable methods could lead to some hostile environmental impacts (Gazali et al., 2017). Yet, if biodegradation is relied on as a natural and cost-effective option for pollutant breakdown and pollution control (Nrior et al., 2017).  The aim of this study is to investigate the biodegradability of drilling fluid in the different soil types. This study, in addition to specifying the ecotoxicological effect of the drilling fluid pollutants in the soil, will chiefly show which soil type most efficiently promotes the drilling waste biodegradability and by implication provide reliable data for policy makers as regards to environmental reclamation</td>

By harnessing density functional theory computations, this program automates the exploration of Kohn-Sham molecular orbitals (KS-MOs), offering invaluable insights into the fundamental driving forces behind the chemical bond formation and reactions. Our primary objective is to develop an intuitive tool that effortlessly generates and consolidates essential details, including orbital overlaps, energy gaps, orbital Gross Mulliken populations, and coefficients of fragment orbitals within the broader molecular orbitals. The PyOrb 1.0 program will address three major challenges associated with the analysis of MO bonding mechanisms: 1. It automatically identifies the dominant orbital interaction patterns. 2. It presents three different orbital interaction schemes corresponding to different stages of bond formation. 3. It constructs the orbital diagram including a final plot summarizing the key molecular orbitals. While we have already created an initial prototype, there are several enhancements required to enhance the usability of our tool. PyOrb 1.0 holds immense potential in simplifying the systematic analysis of atomic and molecular bonding mechanisms, allowing users to concentrate on advanced analysis tasks. We plan to make the PyOrb 1.0 source code openly accessible online, accompanied by an introductory tutorial, to facilitate easy retrieval and utilization.</td>

Molerhealth will provide individuals with a secure and user-friendly platform to access, update, and share their comprehensive health records, regardless of their location or healthcare provider. Through this comprehensive EHR system, patients will have seamless continuity of care, as their medical history, test results, medications,allergies and treatment plans will be readily available to healthcare professionals. By harnessing the power of technology, Molerhealth will significantly reduce the rate of misdiagnoses in Nigeria. Doctors will have access to a complete and up-to-date patient profile, enabling accurate diagnoses, appropriate treatment decisions, and timely referrals to specialists when necessary. Moreover, Molerhealth will facilitate better communication between healthcare providers by providing a platform for secure messaging and consultation, enabling the exchange of vital patient information. This collaboration will lead to more informed decision-making, increased efficiency, and ultimately, improved healthcare outcomes. Through its open-source nature, Molerhealth will encourage community participation, innovation, and customization, making it adaptable to the unique healthcare needs of different regions in Nigeria. It will serve as a catalyst for positive change, empowering individuals, and strengthening the healthcare ecosystem as a whole. Together, we will revolutionize healthcare in Nigeria with Molerhealth, ensuring accurate diagnoses, improved patient care, and a healthier future for all.</td>

      <td>Stabilizing wind power output for grid integration is a challenge due to variable-speed turbines, causing fluctuating power generation. To prevent voltage overloading, the grid power system must undergo rapid changes to maintain stability. The Swing equation is widely used for stability analysis, but its classical model may lead to erroneous conclusions. A modified Swing equation with forced oscillation and nonlinear damping is proposed, using the Lagrangian of the system derived from the maximum entropy principle. Statistical Mechanics preserves the Swing equation for power systems subjected to forced oscillations.

      <td>In the past, researchers have relied on commercial databases for scholarly information such as citations. With the acceleration of open science, open scholarly databases have emerged providing access to everyone for free. However, where commercial providers add a layer of abstraction in the form of aggregations and scientometrics, users of open scholarly data are confronted with raw data that can be difficult to work with. As research intelligence, this is where we step in, aiming to turn raw data into useful information. While making custom reports and dashboards is time-consuming and incurs a cost, we are exploring ways to provide a basic set of open-source tools that can be used by everyone, without charge. Our proposal is a tool that allows researchers to check whether their (fundamental) research is being cited by clinical trials. While traditionally only the number of citations has been used to establish impact of a publication, we aim to provide a more inclusive measure of societal impact by investigating the citation network. We will also explore ways to disseminate impact e.g. through visualisations. This implementation will pave the way for a series of similar tools that promote the recognition of research on various levels.</td>

      <td>The impostor phenomenon (IP) refers to self-doubts about one’s abilities and difficulty internalizing individual accomplishments. These individuals attribute their success to external (e.g., oversight or luck), instead of internal (e.g., intelligence or competence) factors. Therefore, they are worried that they will be found out as intellectual frauds or “impostors”. This phenomenon was first described by Clance and Imes in 1978 and received great attention over the last decades. Although initial researchers suggested that especially women suffer from the impostor phenomenon, more recent empirical evidence regarding gender differences is mixed. The aim of the current meta-analysis is to examine whether or not there are gender differences in the impostor phenomenon to examine where these potential gender differences come from moderation and mediation analysis. When conducting the meta-analysis, we want to follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis for Protocols (PRISMA-P; Moher et al., 2015) and use the PRISMA-P templates developed by Moreau and Gamble (2022). We will preregister our study by uploading these templates (e.g., hypotheses, article searching strategies, screening criteria, codebook) and share all study materials and data via the Open Science Framework. We will also keep a logbook to track all details of our project.</td>

Accomplishing this goal will entail fostering a sense of community, engaging with educators including teachers, lecturers, and professors, as well as actively involving the general public to encourage content creation and course material publication. While platforms like MijnNederlands have been successfully established for specific languages like Dutch, to the best of my knowledge, no such platform currently exists for African languages.

The outputs of this open data repository project will complement an existing Reclone project that aims to establish Regional Reagent Distribution Hubs in partner institutes (in Argentina, Ghana, and the Philippines) for sharing the physical DNA collections, and to help with capacity building within these institutes and local researchers. A parallel project goal would be to produce a landscape analysis and visualisation map of the current DNA Collections users to help future users in identifying local researchers within the Reclone community who may be able to better support their use of the collections.</td>

As part of the open science effort to make scientific data widely available, this project aims to create an Open Community Repository for deposition of raw scientific images. Scientific images are often not accessible to the general audience, educators, and visual artists whose work would benefit from images that portray real scientific spaces, methods, data, and discoveries.

      <td>Gender is a deeply ingrained constructs in human culture and societies. It permeates our everyday activities, whether real or virtual, from social interactions to our digital lives. By nature, the most significant aspects of culture are reflected in scientific progress, determining its development and evolution. The way technological change is shaped and structured is thus inherently grounded in societal norms and relations, which are themselves equally affected by technological transformations. In this sense, the relationship among technology and gender can be considered as mutually constitutive. This relationship is leading to at least two main consequences: i) individuals increasingly encounter representations of gender embedded in technology; ii) machines are being trained to recognize and react to relevant traits of human identity, including gender. These consequences are made even more evident by the increasingly pervasive use of Automatic Face Analysis Systems (AFAS), especially when those systems are based on face recognition. However, these systems are consistently built on a gender binary construct and almost never take into account non-binary individuals, causing exclusion and reinforce existing prejudices about these communities. The project will break this barrier by analysing how algorithms (un)recognize non-binary faces, to foster the development of inclusive, diverse and trustworthy AI.</td>

The nature of this chemical space is mainly governed by the biophysical features of the therapeutic target in study, as well as the synthetic protocols envisioned to obtain new drug candidates. In this way, a plethora of Python packages have been developed in order to solve different problems related to the associated screening workflows. However most of the available solutions as Python packages for the work with chemistry problems functions in an isolated manner, and generates a vast amount of information in heterogeneous ways. In this context, developing systematic and organized approaches to perform such scientific explorations, involving the development of reproducible and adequately organized data processing and storing workflows within structured query databases maximizes the success rate of drug discovery research campaigns. This project is oriented towards generating this kind of solutions, allowing both new and experienced researchers to perform adequately designed and reproducible virtual drug screening campaigns.</td>

      <td>Introduction: Cancer cells reorganize their metabolism to sustain cell growth and adapt to unfavorable microenvironments. Kang and colleagues (2018) state that metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells result in diverse metabolic dependent perturbations that may be targeted for cancer treatment. Generally, for instance, lipid metabolism powers the rapid growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells (Cheng et al., 2016). Nonetheless, little is known about the functions of PEMT in tumor aggression, especially in GBM. Therefore, we hypothesize that PEMT contributes greatly to increased GBM invasion, proliferation and aggression capacities. Methods: To investigate the role of PEMT in GBM aggressiveness, we cloned the PEMT gene into U251 cell lines to overexpress the gene shRNA-mediated knockdown to silence the gene. Overexpression (OE) and knockdown (KD) were validated by microscopy, WB and RT-PCR. We conducted functional assays including, cell proliferation and cell viability. Subsequently, we confirmed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driving markers by RT-PCR and WB.</td>

      <td>I would like to get more familiar with the concepts of open science. In theory, open science should allow us to do science more effectively. However in the present day, there are practical limitations to implementing open science principles. Many entities must come together to play their part in facilitating an open and inclusive research process. I would like to know how these issues may be addressed at different levels, i.e. from researchers, academic institutions and industries, academic publishers, governments etc.</td>

      <td>As stated in my project proposal, I would like to learn more about data platforms and repositories used by researchers in Canada and worldwide. The Indigenous-led research center where I will be delivering workshops is located in a geographically isolated community. Hence, the most effective way for them to connect with the broader research community in Canada and worldwide is through digital platforms, which is why it is critically important that they learn about such platforms. I would also like to learn more about data management tools and software which can be used to organize and process data. For example, as part of the workshops, I would like to help the researchers write data management plans for their own research. Finally, although this is not specifically related to open science, I thought it might be worth mentioning that I will be learning R in the next couple of months. After discussing with members of the research center, we decided that the workshops should involve a brief introduction to programming using R. I am already quite familiar with Python, and have used it extensively as part of my research.</td>
