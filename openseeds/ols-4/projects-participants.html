<p>This project aims to create an <strong>open educational resource</strong> that introduces important concepts for aspiring Bioinformaticians, <strong>written in Spanish</strong>. Topics included in this resource are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The basics of GNU/Linux</li>
  <li>Jupyter Lab</li>
  <li>Terminal usage</li>
  <li>Text and file processing command-line tools (i.e. grep, sed), regex, and pipes</li>
  <li>Text and file processing Bioinformatics exercises</li>
  <li>Make to install software</li>
  <li>SAM Tools: useful pipelines and software for Bioinformatics</li>
  <li>AWK: A programming language for text file processing</li>
  <li>Bash: Shell and programming language</li>
  <li>Git and GitHub for version control</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of a boot camp organized by <a href="https://https://rsg-ecuador.iscbsc.org">RSG Ecuador</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/iGEMECUADOR">iGEM Ecuador</a>, we generated the first version of this resource, available as an <a href="https://rsg-ecuador.github.io/unix.bioinfo.rsgecuador/">e-book</a> powered by <a href="https://jupyterbook.org">Jupyter Book</a> and GitHub. However, this resource has not been launched yet because we have doubts about open licenses, permissions to use external images, and other topics that it would be nice to learn at the <em>OLS-4</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Web application, Genetic engineering, Reproducible research</p>

<p>I want to develop <a href="https://www.genestorian.org/">Genestorian</a>, a web application to manage collections of model organism strains and recombinant DNA, which will store the genetic engineering steps followed to generate new entities from existing ones. The project would consist on developing:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A standard file format to document genetic engineering steps</li>
  <li>A web application to generate this documentation in the browser or programmatically</li>
  <li>A web application with a database to store such information</li>
</ol>

<p>None of the above software pieces, which are all essential for open reproducible science, exists as Open Source, and proprietary solutions do not cover the use-case of model organism research.</p>

<p>Essentially, Genestorian will be a web application that researchers use routinely to consult the “genealogy” of existing biological resources, plan the generation of new resources, and attach experimental data supporting their successful generation.</p>

<p>The cornerstone of this project is the mentioned file format. It will be similar to a data structure for a family tree: it will store a list of entities, and a list of objects describing their relation. Something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
    "entities": [{id:1, ...},{id:2, ...},{id:3, ...}],

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: electoron microscopy and imaging, deep learning</p>

<p>Recent developments in electron microscopy have led to a significant scale-up in the imaging of biological tissues, making throughput a major bottleneck for further progress. Electron microscopes are inherently throughput limited. A new type of scanning electron microscopy, the multibeam electron microscopy, speeds up imaging by scanning the sample with an array of beams instead of a single beam. Furthermore, this microscope makes use of a new detection system based on transmitted electrons and scintillation photons, which provides comparable information to conventional detection methods. To make use of the full potential of this microscope, new methods for data management, data analysis and visualization have to be designed. For example, we would like to employ deep learning methods for automatic segmentation. We would like to apply the multibeam electron microscope to study mitotic cells, zebrafish development and pancreatic stress.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Database, FAIR, Research Community, Open data</p>

<p>We propose to build a database that compiles literature data for the Stöber synthesis of sílica nanoparticles. This data is aimed to generate a database for other studies, such as statistical and machine learning models to guide the design and synthesis of calibrated and monodispersed silica nanoparticles by the Stöber method. The data should follow the FAIR principles to make it findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable, making it public and available for any person that is interested in the study of this synthesis. We also aim at building a community of contributors of new synthesis data to enrich the dataset that will allow better models for Stöber synthesis to be studied. Our long-term vision is that the nanosynthesis research community opens and shares its data as this will advance the nanosynthesis field in a more sustainable way globally.</p>

<p><a href="https://bio-it.embl.de"><strong>Bio-IT</strong></a> project at the <a href="https://www.embl.org">European Molecular Biology Laboratory</a> (EMBL) is a community initiative aiming at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>delivering <strong>training</strong> in computational research skills;</li>
  <li>creating connections between <strong>community</strong> members;</li>
  <li>developing and maintaining resources and supporting <strong>infrastructure</strong>;</li>
  <li>disseminating relevant <strong>information</strong> throughout the community.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to strengthen the community interactions, Bio-IT launched the <a href="https://bio-it.embl.de/grassroots-consulting/"><strong>Grassroots</strong> consulting initiative</a>, listing volunteers among EMBL Staff interested in providing assistance on a wide range of computational topics. Building on this effort, I aim at expanding the crowdsourcing of Bio-IT’s activities and supporting the <strong>community of practice at EMBL</strong>. In line with Open Science objectives, a culture of sharing (of skills, resources, data and ideas) within the institute will also foster the same culture beyond it. Within OLS program, I will elaborate a <strong>Grassroots project strategic plan</strong> by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>identifying actionable information on the current interaction with the community;</li>
  <li>performing a SWOT analysis of community building strategies at EMBL, in particular:</li>
  <li>analysing EMBL-specific challenges and developing strategies to address them;</li>
  <li>defining the project goals, milestones and deliverables and stating them publicly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The objectives of the project are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>strengthening peer-consulting and internal <strong>communication</strong>,</li>
  <li>acknowledging Bio-IT <strong>contributors</strong> and give them visibility,</li>
  <li>renewing the <strong>community interest</strong> in Bio-IT and computational best practices.</li>

<p>Balconnect is a social and environmental intervention with the long-term goal of using open-source, emerging data-driven technologies and open science tools to motivate and enable urbanites to bring active daily experiences of real nature into their lives, as well as to provide them with tools not only to improve their direct, individual natural environment, but to conserve local biodiversity and ecosystem services as well.</p>

<p>Balconnect aims at building knowledge-based people-plant interactions using open, community-focused practices and augmented collaborative learning, while mapping and building a structured network of metropolitan outdoor ornamental plants raised on window sills, balconies, terraces and backyards.
As the open database is being built, participants could gradually:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Document and visualize their personal eco-legacy by learning and sharing nature with their communities (through data, experiences, plants, cultural products).</li>
  <li>Increase demand for locally cultivated and native plants.</li>
  <li>Consciously create biodiverse green patches in private outdoor areas.</li>
  <li>Collect valuable data and conduct open research for science.</li>
  <li>Make cities more liveable, reducing urban green inequalities.</li>
  <li>Influence local government decisions on city planning, green infrastructure and nature-based solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my project, I want to interview several colleagues/peers who were hired or recently started working as generic data stewards at Dutch universities, and, to some extent, Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences – I am one of them. I will rework these interviews into blog posts and analyse what I learnt from these interviews. The interviews will focus on the following elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is their background, how did they enter this job?</li>
  <li>What is expected from them in this role?</li>
  <li>What is their role/position within the landscape of RDM and Open Science support at their institution?</li>
  <li>What skills and competencies do they already have?</li>
  <li>What skills and competencies would they like or need to acquire?</li>
  <li>What does a possible career path look like for them?</li>
</ol>

<p>I will analyse these interviews to make suggestions about necessary training for new generic data stewards, why (and how) they are necessary for the institution, and their possible career paths. We have a blog about the RDM Community at the VU, which is meant to showcase the RDM Community. This is a possible location for my blogs and other progress made in the project.</p>

<p>My project aims to tackle the big gap between the new trend of RNA sequencing analysis and massive expansion of datasets, and the difficulties for wet lab scientists to use this data and even review it when being published. I would also like to create awareness in my community about the necessity on implementing open science and reproducibility tools.
I would like to: 
1st, publish a tutorial from basics level to help people understand the technology and the data analysis behind RNA sequencing. Implement open science tools for this, and introduce every scientist to its existence and need. 
2nd, create a reproducible analysis pipeline, based on my existent one, but incorporating reproducibility basics such as version control and workflows, so researchers can see how the tutorial would work from an existent example.</p>

<p>We plan to create a “Research Software Engineering Association in Asia region – RSE Association (Asia) “. The motive of this association would be to emphasize the importance of good software practices to be adopted by researchers in the Asian academia. Software and programming plays an important part of most of the research in these times. Yet, academia has not fully adopted good modern software practices and principles. We also plan to create an awareness of the Research Software Engineering (RSE) role in Asian academia so that people who have an expertise in software as well as research find a firm footing in academia. The plan in this project is to first build a community of interested people. We would also like to build the technical set-up required for this project like a GitHub repository for easy collaboration; a website which would describe the aims of this association, and would include information on further events of this association; a mailing list which people can use to join this association easily, a Twitter account, and a slack channel in the global RSE slack. This project is highly inspired from the <a href="https://society-rse.org/">Society of Research Software Engineering</a> in the UK.  Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal is the primary applicant of this project, and the one who initiated the project, and came up with the idea.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: Synthetic data, Ethical AI</p>

<p>Operating from a place of data for co-liberation, we have three complementary goals: conduct a landscape analysis of open source synthetic data projects, ask critical questions about the embedded assumptions and ethical considerations in generating synthetic data, and recommend appropriate approaches to synthetic generation for multiple case studies.</p>

<p>We see an urgent need for this work - while methodologies have become more common in the financial policy realm, most applied data researchers outside of large financial or tech companies do not have access to - nor an understanding of - the state of the art approaches, how to evaluate appropriateness of generation for their use cases, and how to evaluate synthetic data fitness for use.</p>

<p>We are expressly sector-agnostic, bringing expertise from health, environment, and education backgrounds to this problem - all sectors with a need for privacy-protecting solutions. Building on sector-agnostic frameworks such as Datasheets for Datasets, and the very recent CDEI-UK PETs Adoption Guide we aim to deliver a similarly sector-agnostic framework for synthetic data generation. With our interdisciplinary background, we will approach the development of such a framework in a way that acknowledges the political nature of data production and openly consider questions of bias, fairness, and ethical AI.</p>

<p>Our initiative is called “Talleres Open Source” (Open Source Workshops in Spanish), a community of scientists teaching and learning about open source tools in Spanish. We organize workshops in which a trainer with experience in a certain method shows others how to apply it using open source tools, and attendees give it a try with short exercises. For example, “Data visualization using Python”, or “Digital Fabrication with FreeCAD”. We have hosted two cycles of 4 workshops spanning 1 month, with both software and hardware tools, as well as two stand-alone events about design heuristics with a local fablab.</p>

<p>The goal of this project is to find common problems within Latin American scientific communities and hold workshops and training courses to tackle these problems. Each of these workshops serve as a way to connect people facing the same problem, introduce them to open source tools and concepts, and enable sharing resources. We hope attendees finish each workshop with a concrete first impression about the method and hands-on experience with the tool to reduce the barrier to adoption.</p>

<p>There is a considerable gap in cases of sub-Saharan African countries regarding assessment of embodied energy of building materials and operational energy of various building types. Lack of open data remains a critical barrier to closing this gap. Creating an open and accessible database of embodied energy of building materials, and operational energy of building typologies will be key in establishing the carbon footprint of buildings in Ghana. The development of an online platform will also allow interested groups, individuals and cooperation’s to submit key information needed for the computation of energy outputs in buildings. The aim of the project is to set up the infrastructure to launch an open database for carbon foot printing of buildings in Ghana, following best practice in open science principles.</p>

<p>Portable land is an urban DIY Agriculture project which aims to create a distributed farm. Currently we have four dedicated sites based in the West Midlands - a washyard which has been converted into a growing space, a community grow room, a patio for urban farming and an indoor DIY aquaponics setup. We are also part of a larger community of urban farmers and DIY horticulturalists in the West Midlands, sharing knowledge and supporting collective organising of growers and urban naturalists.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the project is to create a distributed network of growers and land guardians, but in order to achieve this, we need to develop consistent protocols for understanding environmental quality and biodiversity across our sites as well as shared repositories of data and reports.</p>

<p>We are working on establishing a Research Hub in the National Guard.  This hub is a virtual platform linked to TDM to support academics (particularly young Female researchers), scientists, and physicians. It aims to bridge the boundaries between research, cross-subject collaboration, and establish a community of like-minded people. It will work towards increasing the visibility of ECRs and invite them to apply Open Science practices in their reserach. A part of this Research Hub is to establish a Citizen Science Soil Collection program in Saudi Arabia. This project aims to adapt the Citizen Science approach in Saudi Arabia to bring together researchers with citizens. Our lab focus is the use of metagenomics of Natural Products (NPs) and it is based on King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC). Metagenomics of NPs is an innovative approach that utilizes next-generation sequencing to study microorganisms via the analysis of their DNA acquired directly from an environmental sample. The screening of natural product extracts has traditionally been the most effective method for identifying new compounds with unique cellular targets which are potentially useful as lead structures for the development of new therapeutics.</p>

<p>However, there is hardly any known project which utilises Citizen Science in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, we are collaborating with Open Science community Saudi Arabia (OSASA) to adapt this approach in our current project. This project will engage citizen scientists in collecting and examining soil samples from various regions in Saudi Arabia and bring awareness about the role of Citizen Science in research as  part of the Research Hub.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords</strong>: complexity measures, programming, Python library</p>

<p>I aim to develop a Python library which allows to call and apply several measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated data, and provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures.  </p>

<p>Measures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e., parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two).  </p>

<p>Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite substantially in the last couple of decades,  quantifying emergence is completely new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf, or https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289), but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), programming languages (including Matlab which is not open source).  </p>

<p>A way to easily use &amp; compare a set of state of the art emergence and complexity measures by using a few lines of code is thus missing – this is the gap that I’d  like to fill.</p>

<p>We propose a <strong>living</strong>, <strong>free</strong> and <strong>open</strong> document, named The Environmental AI book, compiling research in the application of AI and Data Science for monitoring and modelling a wide diversity of settings of the natural and urban environments.</p>

<p>Through a set of <strong>interactive use-cases</strong>, the document, powered by Jupyter Book (https://jupyterbook.org), aims to inform and guide the scientific community about information extraction and analysis from environmental sensors (including ground sensors, drones, and satellite Earth observations) using data-driven methods.</p>

<p>In addition to the book, our goal is to <strong>build a community</strong> dedicated to making collaborative, reusable, and transparent research in environmental science. In this regard, inspired by The Turing Way (h https://the-turing-way.netlify.app), we are hosting online 
Collaboration Cafes to engage anyone interested in learning and discussing relevant themes in AI and data science to help understand our changing planet.</p>

<p>While the scientific community is broad, we think the target audience of this book is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers with some background in <strong>environmental science</strong> interested in data-driven methods.</li>
  <li>Researchers with some background in <strong>computer science</strong> interested in environmental studies.</li>
  <li>Anyone else interested in <strong>reproducibility</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong>, <strong>shareable</strong> and <strong>collaborative</strong> AI and data science for environmental applications.</li>

<p>Established in 2018, EROS (education researchers for open science) is an open research working group at the University of York. We monitor and communicate ongoing developments within the open research landscape, provide guidance and training on adopting open practices, and influence incentive structures to recognise commitment to open research practices.</p>

<p>The aim of the <em>EROS Stories</em> project is to deepen EROS as a community of practice by providing a mechanism for junior and senior researchers to engage in dialogue about their experiences with particular open research practices, and to showcase the resulting conversations as publicly available case studies.</p>

<p>Concretely, <em>EROS Stories</em> will pair researchers, at least one of whom must be an ECR, and at least one of whom must have experience with a particular research practice. The less experienced partner (who may be senior) commits to reading at least one primer on a particular open research practice, and then leads a conversation with their partner, asking about their experiences, motivations, and insights and top tips for working with the practice.</p>

<p>The project will help the EROS community build a shared repertoire of experiences, stories, tools and ways of addressing common challenges in doing open, inclusive research.</p>

<p>In academia today there is a certain pressure for young research to publish, and given the time constraints and continuous deadlines, the aspects of reproducibility and replicability are often overlooked. The Turing Way is a great starting point and a guide for people that want get familiar with what needs to be done to make their results, data, hypothesis, etc available to the research community and the public. However, currently it is orientated towards issues encountered mostly in Data Science, and while many of the resources are extendable towards other fields, I consider that it could benefit from specific chapters focused on different research areas. The aim of this project is to create such a chapter by understanding the exact barriers for young researchers when considering reproducible research in Decision Sciences. The guide would be instead of a collection of resources that can be simply used at the end to make “your research more reproducible”, a way of thinking in a way and contain resources that help you consider reproducibility towards the entire research.</p>

<p>Although my research areas are mostly related to wet-lab, with the developed technologies, I am aware that computational and data analysis approaches in research promise great opportunities. Therefore, I am proposing the Open Life Science Survey analysis project to participate in the Open Life Science (OLS) community and make a contribution to the program. In this project, I will be working on already collected survey data from their 3 cohorts. In my opinion, in this era, barriers to open research are not technical but rather socio-cultural. Therefore, by analyzing OLS participant’s survey data, we could gain insight into the demography and socio-culture of the participants. In this way, both OLS team will get a chance to enhance their program for the future and I will learn how to perform data analysis, deal with the survey data and gain some programming skills as well. I believe this opportunity will help me develop my academic skills and give me different perspectives in open research, which are different from but beneficial for my current research.</p>

<p>Binderhub is a service that allows users to share reproducible interactive computing environments through public code repositories. The subject of our project, Hub23, is an organisational deployment of Binderhub, designed to allow Turing Researchers to use binder (the user interface) to collaborate on repositories internal to Turing. This is sometimes necessary if the underlying repository can not be shared for some reason, or is not yet ready to publish openly. During the OLS program, we aim to build an open community around Hub23 to help to guide future technical developments, and encourage use and contributions from the wider Turing community. We will host a series of <a href="https://bit.ly/zero-to-binder-python">Zero-to-Binder workshops</a> aimed at introducing Turing researchers to regular binder, followed by structured discussion of what the ideal features of a collaborative reproducible environment for research would be. Any conclusions and subsequent technical development will be fed upstream to Binderhub, and we also aim to open source the methodologies used to create an internal binderhub deployment, allowing other organisations to do so.</p>

<p>The international and open RIVER UNIVERSITY started in Poland with its pilot in 2018 and the 1st edition in 2020.
Its professional river education has the ambition to change the reality by creating a strong center/network of modern knowledge, linking experts and giving the opportunity to participants to learn about the peculiarities of different rivers in the Baltic region and in Europe.
We provide tools to use in practice, exchange information and experience about inland waters and its impact on the Baltic Sea, to spark joint initiatives for the sake of rivers’ good condition.
Riverine topics always reflect source-to-sea approach and relation to current trends, challenges, legislation regarding freshwaters, and free-flowing rivers: restore nature law, UN restoration decade, Biodiversity strategy 2030, European Green Deal, national recovery plans, etc.
In 2018, the River University mostly served for the purpose of gathering river experts from several transboundary basins of Poland (Odra, Vistula/Western Bug, Neman) with their counterparts from Belarus and Ukraine to discuss i.a. issues related to inland navigation and large infrastructure projects on straightening river flows in these countries. 1st edition of River University in 2020 provided general solid knowledge about healthy rivers, their benefits and threats, presented one of the most stunning rivers in Poland – Drawa river and highlighted current riverine challenges impacting the society. All these looking towards European community goals, as usual.</p>

<p>During the 2nd edition in 2021, we swim into Lithuania’s waters, to dive deep – finally live! – into water challenges in the next country in the Baltic region. We will get to know best practices of good water management, experience with transboundary river cooperation, also innovations and developments within sewerage system management. We can already read about flood risk management and about river barriers to remove or mitigate in the Baltic Sea Region (https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_flood-risk-management-in-the-baltic-sea-region_2021.pdf, https://ccb.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/ccb_report_dam_removal_april_2021.pdf). This time we ask – how are the Lithuanian rivers?
Being a visitor of the largest protected area in Lithuania, crossing rivers outdoor, stepping into practical lectures in the national park, we will also ask about how to limit riverine pollution from tourism and how the connectivity of amazing Lithuanian rivers is ensured.
Checking the European background: how the situation of rivers in Europe looks like in general? Later in time, I may widen it to Europe, not only the Baltic region.</p>

<p>River University has been granted patronage from European Parliament and I seek and encourage water-related institution patronage at every edition. It engages top-level lecturers and universities and practitioners, e.g.: the University of Lausanne, Warsaw University of Life
Sciences, Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries.</p>

<p>In <em>The Turing Way,</em> we want to systematically understand community practices including the community engagement pathways, contributors’ roles and nature of their participation that have been successful at supporting its community of diverse contributors. Simultaneously, we want to identify factors that may currently prohibit short or long term commitments of our contributors and how they can be further supported.</p>

<p>With my participation in OLS-3, I will develop a community health report of the project, capturing community development aspects from growth to retention. I will build upon the Open Source community health metric (<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Contribute/Community_Health</a>), which involves evaluating contributors’ group that is actively involved in a project, number of new contributors that join the project, and members who leave. For online projects, it can also involve tracking the number of community ambassadors, the number of return attendees to events and the rate of churned attendees. Developing an ideal metric in this project will require further deliberation and consultation from The Turing Way team and core contributors. Hence, this project will be collaboratively designed with other community members by actively inviting their contributions and thoughts.</p>

        <p>I am 23 years old and currently working at a sports media company as an editor. I graduated in October 2020 from UCL in MSc Digital Humanities, with a year of experience in journalism. I also have a previous background in history, and I am about to embark on a postgraduate diploma in law, with hopes of pursuing a career at the intersection of law and technology. Also, I’m very keen to help address educational inequity as well as learning more about community building and the open science community!</p>

        <p>I am a Lecturer in Language Education at the University of York in the UK, where I study second language processing and acquisition. My research explores what individual cognitive differences can tell us about the mechanisms underlying second language learning, and how these mechanisms interact with the language environment.</p>

<p>I also work to make research in education and the language sciences open and accessible to all through my work with EROS, IRIS and OASIS.</p>

<p>IRIS (https://iris-database.org) is a collection of instruments, materials, stimuli, and data coding and analysis tools used for research into second languages, including second and foreign language learning, multilingualism, language education, language use and processing.</p>

<p>The OASIS initiative (https://oasis-database.org) is establishing a systematic and sustainable culture of providing open, accessible summaries of research in the language sciences.</p>

<p>EROS (https://osf.io/qwurf/) is an Open Research working group within the Department of Education at York who advocate for more inclusive, open and reproducible research.</p>
