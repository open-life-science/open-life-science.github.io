# OLS Guide to inviting experts to meet project leads

More on what being an OLS expert means: [OLS Expert page]({{ site.url }}/about#experts)

All OLS participants invite at least one expert to discuss their projects. These templates below can help to facilitate the process. 

## Call agenda template

```markdown
- Who is attending 
    - project mentees
    - experts
    - mentor (optional, agree with mentees and experts)
- Intro round (personal)
- Intro to what the OLS project is
- Expert(s) intro - what is your experience and background
- Discussion topics (points where expert's knowledge and project's needs overlap) - try to identify 2-3 points or questions to discuss
    1. 
    2.   
    3. 
```

## Email invitation for mentors

- Email: Include all experts, mentees, mentor in the expert request
- Things to include: 
    - What the project is
    - Why the expert in question was selected
    - When the project leaders are available (include a timezone or arewemeetingyet link)
    - Possible questions / topics you would like to discuss with the expert(s) 
    - If there is pre-reading required, please choose carefully to not overwhelm each other, and make sure to send it in plenty of time.
