# Citing OLS work

If we have helped your research, please cite us and help us to maintain funding!

**Text**
``` 
This work was supported by OLS (we-are-ols.org) as part of its (Open Seeds / Nebula) training programme. 
```

**Markdown**

```md
This work was supported by [OLS](we-are-ols.org) as part of its (Open Seeds / Nebula) training programme. 
```
